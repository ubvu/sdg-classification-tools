https://doi.org/10.1016/j.technovation.2021.102363,Absorbing knowledge from an emerging field,"<p>Engaging with knowledge from an emerging field, with its promises and limitations still uncertain, can be challenging for incumbent firms. Proponents of novel technologies within these firms then play an important role in bridging the developments in the field with the rest of the firm. In this study, we explore how researchers in big pharma firms engaged with knowledge from a promising, yet once-speculative approach called fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD). To set the context, we mapped the publications and drugs in clinical trials coming from this approach across big pharma firms. Through our unique access to researchers in two big pharma firms (an early and a late adopter), we conducted a case study to explore how researchers built the capability within their firms. We find that at each stage of knowledge absorption (search and recognize value, assimilate, acquire, transform and exploit), proponents perform both internal- and external-facing activities to overcome uncertainties with regards to the field. We find that the emphasis of these activities evolves over time as the field evolves. In the early days of the field, proponents of the approach motivated knowledge absorption by emphasizing the internal needs of the firm. As the field matured, with its value becoming increasingly known, proponents lean on the exciting developments in the field to motivate further the adoption of the technology. In general, we find that proponents strategically tuned their external activities to cater to their internal context and similarly, adapted their internal activities to reflect external developments. By exploring interfacing in an emerging field, this study provides insights into how practitioners in large incumbent firms can adapt to the emergence of novel technologies.</p>","van der Sijde, P.

https://doi.org/10.1108/JSTPM-03-2018-0034,Academic entrepreneurship in the context of education,"<p>Purpose: This study aims to extend literature on academic entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial networking by examining how academics, in their role of entrepreneurial educators, network for the creation and execution of novel teaching practices in cooperation with external actors. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical investigation is based on qualitative inquiry, using a case study approach. Specifically, eight cases originating at three universities in Germany, The Netherlands and Mexico were examined. The cases which constituted innovative teaching practices were selected following a replication logic. Each involved extensive participation of societal actors in course development or delivery and aimed to stimulate students to work on real life challenges and disseminate novel knowledge back to the world of practice. All courses were either introduced or taught by educators who possessed different levels and types of academic and industrial or entrepreneurial experience. Findings: Based on eight cases the authors found that the networking behaviour of entrepreneurial educators is crucial for the generation of proximity with external actors and for the acquisition of key resources, such as an external actor to participate in teaching practice and for the generation of legitimacy for their innovations in teaching. The entrepreneurial and industrial experience of entrepreneurial educators emerges as an affordance to network with external actors, helping them to achieve a common understanding of the opportunity and to generate trust among them. Practical implications: This study equips managers of higher education institutions with critical insights into innovating the teaching mission of the university and developing closer and stronger relationships with external actors of the university. Originality/value: This study seeks to advance the literature on academic entrepreneurship by shifting the attention away from academic entrepreneurs as merely founders of spin-offs and collaborators with business on research and development towards entrepreneurial educators who see opportunities in establishing collaborations with external actors as part of their teaching activities. Further, it introduces the “social networking perspective” to this field. Vissa (2012) and Stam (2015) introduced this perspective as a logical extension to the study of the generation of social capital to reach entrepreneurial goals.</p>","Rossano Rivero, S.",Journal of Science and Technology Policy Management,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)",0.0216910243,0.00641208887,0.00515669584,0.0457390547,0.0214759707,0.00643575191,0.00658538938,0.633030236,0.155474752,0.0458990335,0.0221458673,0.0365214646,0.00801682472,0.00931689143,0.0144953728,0.0216840804,0.0703321099,,0.06649485931470589,0.10438916674000003,"SDG 08 (63%) Decent work and economic growth | SDG 09 (16%) Industry, innovation and infrastructure | SDG 17 (7%) Partnerships for the goals","SDG 08 (63%) Decent work and economic growth | SDG 09 (16%) Industry, innovation and infrastructure | SDG 17 (7%) Partnerships for the goals","SDG 08 (63%) Decent work and economic growth | SDG 09 (16%) Industry, innovation and infrastructure",https://aurora-sdg.labs.vu.nl/classifier/classify/aurora-sdg-multi
