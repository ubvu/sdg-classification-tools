Proponents of novel technologies within these firms then play an important role in bridging the developments in the field with the rest of the firm. In this study, we explore how researchers in big pharma firms engaged with knowledge from a promising, yet once-speculative approach called fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD). To set the context, we mapped the publications and drugs in clinical trials coming from this approach across big pharma firms. Through our unique access to researchers in two big pharma firms (an early and a late adopter), we conducted a case study to explore how researchers built the capability within their firms. We find that at each stage of knowledge absorption (search and recognize value, assimilate, acquire, transform and exploit), proponents perform both internal- and external-facing activities to overcome uncertainties with regards to the field. We find that the emphasis of these activities evolves over time as the field evolves. In the early days of the field, proponents of the approach motivated knowledge absorption by emphasizing the internal needs of the firm. As the field matured, with its value becoming increasingly known, proponents lean on the exciting developments in the field to motivate further the adoption of the technology. In general, we find that proponents strategically tuned their external activities to cater to their internal context and similarly, adapted their internal activities to reflect external developments. By exploring interfacing in an emerging field, this study provides insights into how practitioners in large incumbent firms can adapt to the emergence of novel technologies.</p>","van der Sijde, P.

https://doi.org/10.1108/JSTPM-03-2018-0034,Academic entrepreneurship in the context of education,"<p>Purpose: This study aims to extend literature on academic entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial networking by examining how academics, in their role of entrepreneurial educators, network for the creation and execution of novel teaching practices in cooperation with external actors. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical investigation is based on qualitative inquiry, using a case study approach. Specifically, eight cases originating at three universities in Germany, The Netherlands and Mexico were examined. The cases which constituted innovative teaching practices were selected following a replication logic. Each involved extensive participation of societal actors in course development or delivery and aimed to stimulate students to work on real life challenges and disseminate novel knowledge back to the world of practice. All courses were either introduced or taught by educators who possessed different levels and types of academic and industrial or entrepreneurial experience. Findings: Based on eight cases the authors found that the networking behaviour of entrepreneurial educators is crucial for the generation of proximity with external actors and for the acquisition of key resources, such as an external actor to participate in teaching practice and for the generation of legitimacy for their innovations in teaching. The entrepreneurial and industrial experience of entrepreneurial educators emerges as an affordance to network with external actors, helping them to achieve a common understanding of the opportunity and to generate trust among them. Practical implications: This study equips managers of higher education institutions with critical insights into innovating the teaching mission of the university and developing closer and stronger relationships with external actors of the university. Originality/value: This study seeks to advance the literature on academic entrepreneurship by shifting the attention away from academic entrepreneurs as merely founders of spin-offs and collaborators with business on research and development towards entrepreneurial educators who see opportunities in establishing collaborations with external actors as part of their teaching activities. Further, it introduces the “social networking perspective” to this field. Vissa (2012) and Stam (2015) introduced this perspective as a logical extension to the study of the generation of social capital to reach entrepreneurial goals.</p>","Rossano Rivero, S.",Journal of Science and Technology Policy Management,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

Food and pharmaceutical companies, as well as universities, are challenged to collaborate across the innovation value chain to deliver on the promises of microbiota research and development. A shared understanding of the knowledge valorization process is essential for the success of such public-private partnerships. Conceptual models enable stakeholders to discuss and understand complex processes and their corresponding activities but current models are lacking granularity in terms of activities taking place. Building upon the microbiota valorization and technology transfer cycle, this review synthesizes 32 conceptual models on knowledge valorization into a Societal Impact Value Cycle that describes relevant activities. The cycle is contextualized to the microbiota industry and 8 key points for successful innovation are highlighted. The model elucidates the importance of including unmet needs in wider society for generating socioeconomic benefits. While market and society domains contained the highest number of barriers in the probiotics industry, they were scarcely covered by the reviewed literature, highlighting their underexposure. The resulting generally applicable model aids stakeholders in outlining a thorough strategy to deliver really new and radical innovations.</p>","van der Waal, M.B.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phanu.2020.100208,A critical appreciation of intangible resources in PharmaNutrition,"<p>Background: Organizations in knowledge-intensive industries such as the field of PharmaNutrition benefit from a critical consideration of intangible resources for innovation performance and competitive advantage. Effective management of these resources, however, is complicated due to difficulties in their identification, appropriation, application, and evaluation. As a consequence, knowledge-intensive organizations are at risk of suboptimal exploitation of their most important value drivers. Methods: The literature on organizational intangible resources was reviewed as part of an ongoing investigation into effective management of intangible resources in the PharmaNutrition-specific context. Results: Although high-level dimensions of intangible resources are recognized across industries, the identity and relevance of various lower-level components are heterogenous and dependent on organization's unique situational attributes. Despite the existence of historical, industry-sourced tick-the-box lists presented here, an analysis of industry-specific characteristics of intangible resources and mechanisms to appropriate their value is warranted to enable practitioners to innovate effectively and efficiently. Conclusions: This editorial aims to put the topics of intangible resources and their appropriability on the agenda, and invites scholars and practitioners to contribute to the advancement of our understanding regarding these topics through an online survey.</p>","van der Waal, R.X.

The integration of genomic, transcript, protein, metabolite, flux, and computational data yields unprecedented information about the system level functioning of organisms. Often, data integration is done purely computationally, leaving the user with little insight in addition to statistical information. In this article, we present a visualization tool for the metabolic network of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, an important model cyanobacterium for sustainable biofuel production. We illustrate how this metabolic map can be used to integrate experimental and computational data for Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 systems biology and metabolic engineering studies. Additionally, we discuss how this map, and the software infrastructure that we supply with it, can be used in the development of other organism-specific metabolic network visualizations. In addition to the Python console package VoNDA (http://vonda.sf.net), we provide a working demonstration of the interactive metabolic map and the associated Synechocystis sp.

This emerging market has expressed the pressing need for clarity on the subject of applicable IP methods. The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate the role of patents and alternative IP instruments for the protection of innovations in the MN market, and to construct an IP decision framework facilitating IP selection. Data collection consists of a literature study on the topic of IP strategies, combined with a supplementary questionnaire sent out to MN companies.Although there are many different strategic motives to apply for a patent in the MN market, the classic protective motives prove to be most important. While our findings acknowledge that patenting is of paramount importance to this industry, different scenarios call for combining the various IP methods for the optimal protection of the MN innovation. One must therefore always carefully consider additional IP rights. Our IP decision framework provides both MN companies and academic R&D departments with a tool to assess the best applicable IP strategy for the protection of MN inventions. © 2013 .","Claassen, H.J.H.M.

In developing countries where highly suffer from lack of this process, incremental innovation is considered as main source of technology capability building and development In moving toward this pass and to meet with time pressure of catching up, developing countries acquire the initial required knowledge base through technology absorption from outside sources; On the other hand as development is a lengthy process, it is important that the absorbed knowledge still has the potential of more advancement in future. Therefore a selection instrument with ability of assessing different knowledge base or technologies in a dynamic way is highly attractive for decision makers.

The traveling waves can be identified with the bounded solutions of the (Formula Prtsented) Ω ⊂ R d is a bounded domain, Δ is the Laplacian on Ω, and B denotes Dirichlet, Neumann, or periodic boundary data. We develop a new homological invariant for the dynamics of the bounded solutions of the above elliptic PDE. Restrictions on the nonlinearity f are kept to a minimum; for instance, any nonlinearity exhibiting polynomial growth in u can be considered. In particular, the set of bounded solutions of the traveling wave PDE may not be uniformly bounded. Despite this, the homology is invariant under lower order (but not necessarily small) perturbations of the nonlinearity f, thus making the homology amenable for computation. Using the new invariant we derive lower bounds on the number of bounded solutions of our PDE, thus obtaining existence and multiplicity results for traveling wave solutions of reaction-diffusion equations on unbounded cylinders.</p>","van der Vorst, R.C.A.M.

However, there is limited empirical research on this phenomenon. The purpose of this study is twofold: (i) to develop a framework for businesses to digitally transform their business models and (ii) to examine literature in order to identify and analyse the constructs underlying the three concepts of Digitalisation, Digital Transformation and Business Model Innovation. The study is qualitative in nature and is based on a narrative review. Relevant articles were identified by using international bibliographic databases and scrutinised using thematic analysis. The findings reveal that the first two constructs require digital capabilities and a digital strategy. The third construct requires digital transformation in the realm of customer-centricity, resources, processes and profit. A set of propositions was formulated and the commonalities were mapped. Based upon this map, a conceptual framework was developed. The findings will assist in the development of future instruments that can guide businesses to digitally transform existing business model elements. This study aims to fill the gap on how business model innovation should be pursued through digital transformation by developing a conceptual framework.","van Tonder, C.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2023.109194,A generalized natural hazard risk modelling framework for infrastructure failure cascades,"<p>Critical infrastructures are more exposed than ever to natural hazards in a changing climate. To understand and manage risk, failure cascades across large, real-world infrastructure networks, and their impact on people, must be captured. Bridging established methods in both infrastructure and risk modelling communities, we develop an open-source modelling framework which integrates a network-based interdependent infrastructure system model into the globally consistent and spatially explicit natural hazard risk assessment platform CLIMADA. The model captures infrastructure damages, triggers failure cascades and estimates resulting basic service disruptions for the dependent population. It flexibly operates on large areas with publicly available hazard, exposure and vulnerability information, for any set of infrastructure networks, hazards and geographies of interest. In a validated case study for 2018’s Hurricane Michael across three US states, the model reproduced important failure dynamics among six infrastructure networks, and provided a novel spatial map where people were likely to experience disruptions in access to healthcare, loss of power and other vital services. Our generalized approach allows for a view on infrastructure risks and their social impacts also in areas where detailed information and risk assessments are traditionally scarce, informing humanitarian activities through hotspot analyses and policy frameworks alike.</p>","Koks, E.E.",Reliability Engineering and System Safety,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

To make such training environments more effective, the agent paradigm has proven to be a useful tool. By conceptualising a training system as a 'virtual tutor', the system may be able to support the trainee in a similar manner as human instructors do, among others by providing personalised feedback and adaptive training material. The current paper describes a project that has as aim to develop a virtual training environment for decision making under stress, targeted at professionals in the public domain. The main contribution is two-fold: first, a global overview of the project is presented. Second, a formal approach is put forward for the design of the training environment, based on agent-based simulation and verification. By generating a computational model of the envisioned system and formally analysing the resulting simulation runs, the behaviour of the system can be studied before its actual implementation, thus providing a method for rapid prototyping.","Bosse, T.

We use data on employment growth of site-industries on 68 formal industrial sites in the municipality of Amsterdam between 1998 and 2006.

Global Expected Annual Damages (EAD) due to direct damage to road and railway assets range from 3.1 to 22 billion US dollars, of which ~73% is caused by surface and river flooding. Global EAD are small relative to global GDP (~0.02%). However, in some countries EAD reach 0.5 to 1% of GDP annually, which is the same order of magnitude as national transport infrastructure budgets.

https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2009-2372,A high-throughput cheese manufacturing model for effective cheese starter screening.,"Cheese making is a process in which enzymatic coagulation of milk is followed by protein separation, carbohydrate removal, and an extended bacterial fermentation. The number of variables in this complex process that influence cheese quality is so large that the developments of new manufacturing protocols are cumbersome. To reduce screening costs, several models have been developed to miniaturize the cheese manufacturing process. However, these models are not able to accommodate the throughputs required for systematic screening programs. Here, we describe a protocol that allows the parallel manufacturing of approximately 600 cheeses in individual cheese vats each with individual process specifications. Protocols for the production of miniaturized Gouda- and Cheddar-type cheeses have been developed. Starting with as little as 1.7 mL of milk, miniature cheeses of about 170 mg can be produced and they closely resemble conventionally produced cheese in terms of acidification profiles, moisture and salt contents, proteolysis, flavor profiles, and microstructure. Flavor profiling of miniature cheeses manufactured with and without mixed-strain adjunct starter cultures allowed the distinguishing of the different cheeses. Moreover, single-strain adjunct starter cultures engineered to overexpress important flavor-related enzymes revealed effects similar to those described in industrial cheese. Benchmarking against industrial cheese produced from the same raw materials established a good correlation between their proteolytic degradation products and their flavor profiles. These miniature cheeses, referred to as microcheeses, open new possibilities to study many aspects of cheese production, which will not only accelerate product development but also allow a more systematic approach to investigate the complex biochemistry and microbiology of cheese making. © American Dairy Science Association, 2009.","Bachmann, H.

https://doi.org/10.1186/s13068-018-1037-8,Alignment of microbial fitness with engineered product formation,"<p>Background: Microbial bioengineering has the potential to become a key contributor to the future development of human society by providing sustainable, novel, and cost-effective production pipelines. However, the sustained productivity of genetically engineered strains is often a challenge, as spontaneous non-producing mutants tend to grow faster and take over the population. Novel strategies to prevent this issue of strain instability are urgently needed. Results: In this study, we propose a novel strategy applicable to all microbial production systems for which a genome-scale metabolic model is available that aligns the production of native metabolites to the formation of biomass. Based on well-established constraint-based analysis techniques such as OptKnock and FVA, we developed an in silico pipeline - FRUITS - that specifically 'Finds Reactions Usable in Tapping Side-products'. It analyses a metabolic network to identify compounds produced in anabolism that are suitable to be coupled to growth by deletion of their re-utilization pathway(s), and computes their respective biomass and product formation rates. When applied to Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, a model cyanobacterium explored for sustainable bioproduction, a total of nine target metabolites were identified. We tested our approach for one of these compounds, acetate, which is used in a wide range of industrial applications. The model-guided engineered strain shows an obligatory coupling between acetate production and photoautotrophic growth as predicted. Furthermore, the stability of acetate productivity in this strain was confirmed by performing prolonged turbidostat cultivations. Conclusions: This work demonstrates a novel approach to stabilize the production of target compounds in cyanobacteria that culminated in the first report of a photoautotrophic growth-coupled cell factory. The method developed is generic and can easily be extended to any other modeled microbial production system.</p>","Hellingwerf, K.J.

However, our understanding of how interorganizational networks govern themselves when developing innovations is still limited. Most network management literature does not focus on the activities employed by network actors and/or does not recognize that there may be different modes of network management. This study explores how, why and in which combination network management activities are employed in a network and in doing so proposes a new conceptualization of network management. Using primary and secondary data pertaining to eleven innovation projects, this study reveals how network management consists of combinations of (rather than individual) management activities undertaken to manage a network. This study identifies three distinct modes of network management: basically coordinated, control-oriented and reward-oriented. Moreover, this study proposes that network actors try to match the management mode to their prevailing mental model as well as the type of network (e.g. in terms of project innovativeness).</p>","Klein Woolthuis, R.J.A.",Industrial Marketing Management,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

The promise of data to help address societal issues and foster innovation requires public organizations to work together with businesses and researchers. Data collaboratives whereby actors collaborate to share and use data for public good gain increasing interest. Most of these collaborations, however, tend to be one-off, small, and limited in impact due to a complex web of legal, technical, ethical, commercial, and organizational challenges. Initiators of data collaboratives, termed as conveners, can potentially alleviate some of these concerns by playing various roles in developing a more sustainable data ecosystem for the data collaboratives. Our study investigates what convener roles are perceived to be critical in developing data collaboratives. By drawing on data ecosystems thinking, we developed a framework of convener roles and sub-roles which we further used to analyze four cases in the Netherlands and Sweden. We conclude that connecting role and learning catalyst role are critical at the initiation stage, while stimulating and mediating roles emerge as future critical roles as the data ecosystem develops. We further identified convener meta-roles that are associated with particular data ecosystem structures (keystone-centric, marketplace-based, intermediary-based, and platform-centric). Our research can be instrumental to actors leading the efforts of creating such data ecosystems as it provides insights on the needs and resources that can be leveraged to stimulate development and innovation.</p>","van den Broek, T.A.",Government Information Quarterly,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+2 more)"

To sustain their highly variable load, game operators over-provision a large static infrastructure capable of sustaining the game peak load, even though a large portion of the resources is unused most of the time. This inefficient resource utilisation has negative economic impacts by preventing any but the largest hosting centres from joining the market and dramatically increases prices. In this paper, we propose a new business model of hosting and operating MMOGs based on Cloud computing principles involving four actors: resource provider, game operator, game provider, and client. Our model efficiently provisions on-demand virtualised resources to game sessions based on their dynamic client load, which dramatically decreases prices and gives small and medium enterprises the opportunity of joining the market through zero initial investment. We validate our new model and its underlying business relationships through trace-based simulations utilising six months worth of monitoring data from a real-life MMOG using emulated resources from 16 of the largest Cloud resource providers currently on the market. We demonstrate that our model can operate state-of-the-art MMOGs with an average monthly gross profit of nearly $6 million excluding game purchase prices, overheads and taxation, while being able to maintain and control the QoS offered to all clients. Finally, we show how our approach is capable of operating next generation very highly interactive MMOGs with a small increase of 5.8% in the subscription price.","Iosup, A.",,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

We assume known and constant production of end products at the plant that generates a synchronized production of components at each supplier. The lean production philosophy motivates two distinctive features of our formulation. To facilitate standardized work, we consider inventory collection plans that are cyclic and repeatable into the near future. To support the notion of level production planning, we consider inventory collection plans such that the pickup amount at each supplier is a multiple of the daily demand and in exact proportion to the number of days since the last pickup. We study the polyhedron of the convex hull of our mathematical formulation and define new valid inequalities that we implement within our branch-and-cut algorithm for the problem. As our computational experiments confirm, our cyclic formulation is significantly more difficult to solve to optimality than the standard non-cyclic formulation. Regardless, our three-phase approach obtains competitive results for one-, two-, and three-vehicle instances over three- and six-period planning horizons.</p>","Paradiso, R.",European Journal of Operational Research,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

https://doi.org/10.1145/3148011.3148014,An ontology-based approach to improve the accessibility of ROS-based robotic systems,"<p>The focus of this work is to exploit ontologies to make robotic systems more accessible to non-expert users, therefore supporting the deployment of robot-integrated applications. Due to the increasing number of robotic platforms available for commercial use, robotic systems are nowadays being approached by users with different backgrounds, who are often more interested in the robots' high-level capabilities than their technical architecture. Without the right expertise however, using robots is restricted to the capabilities exposed by the platform provider, i.e. they can only be used as end products rather than as development platforms. Our hypothesis is that an ontological representation of the capabilities of robots could make these capabilities more accessible, reducing the complexity of robot programming and enabling non-experts to exploit these systems to a much larger extent. To demonstrate this, an ontology abstracting the capabilities exposed by the most common robotic middleware (ROS) is integrated in a system to allow non-experts to program robots of different types and capabilities without previous knowledge either of the specific robotic platform being considered, or of the intricate systems used in its implementation. Our experiments, in which non-experts users had to configure the system in order to make robots achieve different tasks, show how the efforts required for realizing basic tasks using available robotic platforms can be sensibly reduced through our approach.</p>","Tiddi, I.",,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

The foreign firm is more R&D efficient and is based in a larger and richer market. The unique (risk-dominant) Nash equilibrium exhibits intra-industry trade, and the foreign producer manufactures a higher-quality product. When transport costs are low, unilateral dumping by the foreign firm arises; otherwise, reciprocal dumping occurs. For some parameters, a domestic antidumping policy leads to a quality reversal in the international market whereby the home firm becomes the quality leader.

In order to address the long-term nature of the problem, in which the exact (future) demand of service is unknown, we develop a ""timetable""-free approach to avoid the specification of a particular timetable. We consider a generic infra-element that allows a concise representation of many different combinations of infrastructure, safety systems and traffic regimes, such as mixed double and single track lines (e.g., a double track line including a single tunnel tube), and train operations on partly overlapping routes at station yards. We translate the capacity assessment problem for such a generic infra-element into an optimization problem and provide a solution procedure. We illustrate our approach with a capacity assessment for the newly built high-speed railway line in The Netherlands. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Determination of capacity levels is difficult because capacities often need to be set long before demand realizes. In order to avoid capacity-demand mismatches, operations managers employ mix-flexible resources which allow them to shift excess demands to unused capacities. The Flexibility Design Problem (FDP) models the decision on the optimal configuration of a flexible (manufacturing) network. FDP is a difficult stochastic optimization problem, for which traditional exact approaches are not able to solve but the smallest instances in reasonable time. We develop a Flexibility Design Genetic Algorithm (FGA) that exploits qualitative insights into the structure of good solutions, such as the well-established chaining principle, to enhance its performance. FGA is compared to a commercial solver, a simple GA, and a Simulated Annealing local search on instances of up to 15 demand types and resources. Experimental evidence shows that the proposed approach outperforms the competing methods with respect to both computing time and solution quality.","Vigo, D.",International Journal of Production Economics,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

However, despite mounting evidence and opportunities in the field, relatively few strains are commercially available and probiotics are seldom in routine use in clinical practice. Innovation in the field of probiotics seems hampered. Using the barrier approach, this study identified the main barriers in the probiotic innovation process, as experienced by key-opinion-leaders (KOLs). These innovation barriers are visualised and their underlying causes revealed by means of qualitative root cause analysis. The root causes were placed in an academic-industrial valorisation cycle. Furthermore, a quantitative ranking of the barriers was used to demonstrate their relative importance. This study demonstrates that the probiotic research cycle is faulty due to specific barriers and bypasses, and that innovation is hampered in all domains of the valorisation cycle. Eleven main barriers were identified, with “difficulty in demonstrating clinical efficacy” being the most significant inhibiting factor. Other barriers could be classified as fundamental research barriers, clinical research barriers, financial barriers, regulatory barriers, collaboration barriers, marketing barriers and product barriers. Using this barrier approach, inhibiting factors are identified which allows subsequent action to be taken to re-establish the natural cycle of innovation.","van den Nieuwboer, M.

Here we analyzed nuclear polymorphism and mitochondrial data (mtDNA) from ancient central and western Anatolian sheep dating from Epipaleolithic to late Neolithic, comparatively with modern-day breeds and central Asian Neolithic/Bronze Age sheep (OBI). Analyzing ancient nuclear data, we found that Anatolian Neolithic sheep (ANS) are genetically closest to present-day European breeds relative to Asian breeds, a conclusion supported by the mtDNA haplogroup frequencies. In contrast, OBI showed higher genetic affinity to present-day Asian breeds. These results suggest that east-west genetic structure observed in present-day breeds had already emerged by 6000 BCE, hinting at multiple sheep domestication episodes or early wild introgression in southwest Asia. Furthermore, we found that ANS are genetically distinct from all modern breeds. Our results suggest that European and Anatolian domestic sheep gene pools have been strongly remolded since the Neolithic.","Gerritsen, F.A.",Communications biology,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

Unfortunately, little research is available on how cloud consumers can reduce their energy footprint when running software in the public cloud. Moreover, cloud consumers do not have full access to information regarding their cloud infrastructure usage, which is required to understand the impact of design decisions on energy usage. The purpose of our study is to support cloud consumers in developing energy-efficient workloads in the public cloud. To achieve our goal, we collaborated with a large cloud solution provider to discover an initial set of reusable architectural tactics for software energy efficiency. Starting from interviews with 17 practitioners, we reviewed and selected available tactics to improve the energy efficiency of individual workloads in the public cloud, and synthetized the identified tactics in a reusable model. In addition, we conducted a case study to assess the impact of utilizing a tactic, which was selected following a prioritization provided by the practitioners. Our results demonstrate the possibility to architect cloud workloads for energy efficiency through reasoning and estimation of resource optimization. However, the process is not (yet) straightforward due to the current lack of transparency of cloud providers. </p>","Verdecchia, R.

Most studies have applied statistical approaches to historical data from developed countries to identify these impacts, while some have also used theoretical and computational modeling to assess future risks under climate change scenarios. The findings show that natural disasters and climate change risks generally lower insurer profitability and risk-sharing capacity, bank stability and credit supply, returns and stability of stock and bond markets, foreign direct investment inflows, and international lending. Factors such as income levels, rigorous financial regulations, capital abundance, market diversification, and adaptation strategies mitigate the negative effects. Natural disasters increase remittance inflows and financial assistance to low- and middle-income countries. We recommend future research on forward-looking computational modeling to assess the future financial sector impacts of climate change, while accounting for adaptation actions and their drivers. Future research should also consider hazard correlations and the interactions between financial industries and regions to more comprehensively assess the economic effects of natural disasters in general and for vulnerable countries in particular.</p>","Endendijk, T.

This adaptation concerns also the security, as one of the most important properties of these systems. Though the state of the art on adaptivity in terms of security related to these systems can often deal well with fully anticipated situations in the environment, it becomes a challenge to deal with situations that are not or only partially anticipated. This uncertainty is however omnipresent in these systems due to humans in the loop, open-endedness and only partial understanding of the processes happening in the environment. In this paper, we partially address this challenge by featuring an approach for tackling access control in face of partially unanticipated situations. We base our solution on special kind of aspects that build on existing access control system and create a second level of adaptation that addresses the partially unanticipated situations by modifying access control rules. The approach is based on our previous work where we have analyzed and classified uncertainty in security and trust in such systems and have outlined the idea of access-control related situational patterns. The aspects that we present in this paper serve as means for application-specific specialization of the situational patterns. We showcase our approach on a simplified but real-life example in the domain of Industry 4.0 that comes from one of our industrial projects. </p>","Gerostathopoulos, I.G.",,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

This study assessed the capacity to perform newborn resuscitation at facilities offering comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care (EmONC) in Afghanistan, as well as individual and facility characteristics associated with providers' knowledge and clinical skills.Methods: Assessors interviewed 82 doctors and 142 midwives at 78 facilities on their knowledge of newborn resuscitation and observed them perform the procedure on an anatomical model. Supplies, equipment, and infrastructure were assessed at each facility. Descriptive statistics and simple and multivariate regression analyses were performed using STATA 11.2 and SAS 9.1.3.Results: Over 90% of facilities had essential equipment for newborn resuscitation, including a mucus extractor, bag, and mask. More than 80% of providers had been trained on newborn resuscitation, but midwives were more likely than doctors to receive such training as part of pre-service education (59% and 35%, respectively, p < 0.001). No significant differences were found between doctors and midwives on knowledge, clinical skills, or confidence in performing newborn resuscitation. Doctors and midwives scored 71% and 66%, respectively, on knowledge questions and 66% and 71% on the skills assessment; 75% of doctors and 83% of midwives felt very confident in their ability to perform newborn resuscitation. Training was associated with greater knowledge (p < 0.001) and clinical skills (p < 0.05) in a multivariable model that adjusted for facility type, provider type, and years of experience offering EmONC services.Conclusions: Lack of equipment and training do not pose major barriers to newborn resuscitation in Afghanistan, but providers' knowledge and skills need strengthening in some areas. Midwives proved to be as capable as doctors of performing newborn resuscitation, which validates the major investment made in midwifery education. Competency-based pre-service and in-service training, complemented by supportive supervision, is an effective way to build providers' capacity to perform newborn resuscitation. This kind of training could also help skilled birth attendants based in the community, at private clinics, or at primary care facilities save the lives of newborns. © 2013 Kim et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","van Roosmalen, J.J.M.",BMC Pediatrics,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

CAD/CAM supports using a digital workflow reduce the number of visits, chair time, and laboratory time, making it attractive to patients. This study aimed to provide a comparative review of complete dentures manufactured using CAD/CAM and conventional methods. The PubMed/Medline, Science Direct, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases were searched for studies published in English within the last 11 years (from 2011 to 2021). The keywords used were “computer-engineered complete dentures”, “CAD/CAM complete dentures”, “computer-aided engineering complete dentures”, and “digital complete dentures”. The search yielded 102 articles. Eighteen relevant articles were included in this review. Overall, computer-engineered complete dentures have several advantages over conventional dentures. Patients reported greater satisfaction with computer-engineered complete dentures (CECDs) due to better fit, reduced chair time, shorter appointments, and fewer post-insertion visits. CAD/CAM allows for precision and reproducibility with fewer procedures compared to conventional dentures. Polymethyl methacrylate is used as the denture base material for conventional dentures. For CECDs, the resin can be modified and cross-linked to improve its mechanical properties. The advantages of CECDs include a reduced number of appointments, saving chairside time, a digital workflow allowing easy reproducibility and greater patient satisfaction with a better fit.</p>","Mendes Tribst, J.P.",Materials,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

Effective water management is required at refineries to ensure their efficient and responsible operation with respect to the water environment. However, ascertaining the potential environmental risks associated with discharge of refinery effluents to receiving waters is challenging because of their compositional complexity. Recent European research and regulatory initiatives propose a more holistic approach including biological effect methods to assess complex effluents and surface water quality. The study presented here investigated potential effects of effluent composition, particularly hydrocarbons, on aquatic toxicity and was a component of a larger study assessing contaminant removal during refinery wastewater treatment (Hjort et al 2021). The evaluation of effects utilised a novel combination of mechanistic toxicity modelling based on the exposure composition, measured bioavailable hydrocarbons using biomimetic solid phase microextraction (BE-SPME), and bioassays. The results indicate that in the refinery effluent assessments measured bioavailable hydrocarbons using BE-SPME was correlated with the responses in standard bioassays. It confirms that bioassays are providing relevant data and that BE-SPME measurement, combined with knowledge of other known non-hydrocarbon toxic constituents, provide key tools for toxicity identification. Overall, the results indicate that oil refinery effluents treated in accordance to the EU Industrial Emissions Directive requirements have low to negligible toxicity to aquatic organisms and their receiving environments. Low-cost, animal-free BE-SPME represents a compelling tool for rapid effluent characterization.</p>","Leonards, P.E.G. (+1 more)",Chemosphere,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

Here, we demonstrate a framework to simultaneously constrain the representation of tree growth and physiology in the ORCHIDEE global land surface model using the simulated variability of tree-ring width and carbon (""13C) and oxygen (18O) stable isotopes in six sites in boreal and temperate Europe. We exploit the resulting tree-ring triplet to derive integrative constraints for leaf physiology and growth from well-known mechanistic relationships among the variables. ORCHIDEE simulates ""13C (rCombining double low line0.31-0.80) and 18O (rCombining double low line0.36-0.74) better than tree-ring width (r<0.55), with an overall skill similar to that of a tree-ring model (MAIDENiso) and another isotope-enabled global vegetation model (LPX-Bern). The comparison with tree-ring data showed that growth variability is not well represented in ORCHIDEE and that the parameterization of leaf-level physiological responses (stomatal control) to drought stress in the temperate region can be constrained using the interannual variability of tree-ring stable isotopes. The representation of carbon storage and remobilization dynamics emerged as a critical process to improve the realism of simulated growth variability, temporal carryover, and recovery of forest ecosystems after climate extremes. Simulated forest gross primary productivity (GPP) correlates with simulated tree-ring ""13C and 18O variability, but the origin of the correlations with tree-ring 18O is not entirely physiological. The integration of tree-ring data and land surface models as demonstrated here should guide model improvements and contribute towards reducing current uncertainties in forest carbon and water cycling. </p>","Luyssaert, S.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tra.2007.08.001,Auctioning concessions for private roads,"Private toll roads are now seriously considered as an alternative to public (free-access) road infrastructure. Nevertheless, complete private provision without governmental control is only rarely considered. A main consideration against private roads would be that operators would be primarily interested in maximizing profits, which - given the market power they will have - will typically not lead to welfare-maximizing tolls and capacities. An important question is whether these discrepancies can be mitigated by a proper design of auctions for concessions of private roads. This paper therefore analyses capacity choice and toll setting by private investors in a competitive bidding framework organized by the government. We develop a two-link network simulation model with an untolled alternative to determine relative efficiency effects, and analyze rules for the government to organize the bidding process such that a more desired (welfare optimal) outcome is achieved. Our results show that, depending on the design of the auction, its outcomes may vary strongly, and may approach the maximum possible (second-best) welfare gains. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Although for the past decade the number of MMOG players has grown exponentially, to the current tens of millions, this very growth may now hamper the progress of this important branch of the entertainment business. To guarantee Quality of Service (QoS) to a highly variable number of concurrent users, operators statically over-provision a large infrastructure capable of sustaining the game peak load, even though a large portion of the resources is unused most of the time. To address this problem, we propose a Cloud middleware-based system for autonomous operation of MMOGs. Our system provisions resources on-demand from multiple Cloud providers, automatically distributes the MMOG load between these resources, and self-heals when confronted with unforeseen resource failures. This new operational model allows small and medium enterprises to join the competitive MMOG market through near-zero initial infrastructure investment and operate MMOGs at given levels of QoS with small human intervention. We evaluate through simulations based on real-life MMOG traces the impact of resource availability on the QoS offered to the MMOG clients. We find that: (1) our proposed MMOG operation system can mitigate the negative effects of resource failures in under four minutes, (2) MMOG server consolidation in a resource-scarce environment can accentuate the negative effects of resource failures, and (3) the competition for resources can indirectly affect the QoS of the MMOG sessions. © 2013 ACM.","Iosup, A.",,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

A reason could be that dedicated courses on software testing are rare. However, even when such a course exists, students perceive testing as a boring, unrewarding and even dogmatic chore. For more than 10 years, we have been teaching a software testing course at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. Driven by our belief that an abundant exposure to software bugs makes good testers, we experimented with many ideas to engage students and make them love the topic. The most unorthodox, yet effective interventions we are proud of, were: (1) to scare students by analyzing past, software-related accidents, such as Therac-25 or Boeing 737-MAX; (2) to thrill them using bug-hunting gamification, enabled by the in-house developed VU-BugZoo; (3) to trust them an end-To-end testing of safety-critical software-intensive systems, such as model trains, automatic insulin pumps and even radiotherapy facilities, and (4) to inspire their career, by opening a dialog with test professionals from industry. The result is a mature course, read yearly by 50 computer science graduates, where almost 80% of the participants find the topic interesting and challenging, and 40% consider a future carrier in testing.

We use a cross-country sample of 2582 firms in 25 developed and developing European countries. Our results show that the intensity of borrower discouragement decreases with the level of bank market power, and this result is robust to the use of concentration and industrial organization measures of competition. When our model allows for non-monotonic effects, we show that more bank market power might increase borrower discouragement for firms operating in less developed economies and in countries with a high degree of bank market power. These results explain the conflicting evidence provided in previous literature concerning countries with different levels of economic development and bank market power. Our paper sets limits to the continuous concentration process in the European banking market, which may result in more discouraged and financially restricted SMEs.</p>","Kant, J.",Small Business Economics,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

These hamper their potential societal benefit and impairs the ability to quickly respond to emerging new pathogens. This is especially worrisome since new pathogens are emerging at all-time high rates of over one per year, and many age-old pathogens are still not vaccine preventable.Through interviews with 20 key-opinion-leaders (KOLs), this study identified innovation barriers that increase vaccine development timelines. These innovation barriers were visualized, and their underlying causes revealed by means of qualitative root cause analysis. Based on a survey the innovation barriers were quantitatively ranked based on their relative impact on both regular, and Covid-19 vaccine development timelines. KOLs identified 20 key innovation barriers, and mapping these barriers onto the Vaccine Innovation Cycle model revealed that all phases of vaccine development were affected. Affected by most barriers is the area between the preclinical studies and the market entry. Difficult hand-off between academia and industry, lack of funding, and lack of knowledge of pathogen targets were often mentioned as causes. Quantitative survey responses from 93 KOLs showed that general vaccine development and Covid-19 vaccine development are impacted by distinct sets of innovation barriers. For the general vaccine development three barriers were perceived of the highest impact; limited ROI for vaccines addressing disease with limited market size, limited ROI for vaccines compared to non-vaccine projects, and academia not being able to progress beyond proof of principle. Of highest impact on Covid-19 vaccine development, are lack of knowledge concerning pathogen target, high risk of upscaling unlicensed vaccines, and proof of principle not meeting late-stage requirements. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that barriers hampering timelines in vaccine development are present across the Vaccine Innovation Cycle. Prioritizing the impact of barriers in general, and in Covid-19 vaccine development, shows clear differences that can be used to inform policies to speed up development in both war and peace time.</p>","van de Burgwal, L.H.M.

Effective patient enrolment can reduce delays and save costs, offering patients an opportunity to benefit from innovative treatments. However, the current evidence base does not fully explain the persistence of barriers to patient enrolment in phase III cancer clinical trials. The aim was to explore clinicians' and pharmaceutical representatives' views on these barriers. DESIGN: A qualitative study was performed. In-depth information was collected from 15 experts in the field of oncology clinical trials, in particular clinical oncologists acting as principal investigators (PIs) and clinical research associates. By means of semistructured interviews, based on a questionnaire derived from our newly developed conceptual framework, they were asked to identify barriers to patient enrolment they had experienced and comment on barriers identified in literature. FINDINGS: Existing knowledge on barriers to patient enrolment was confirmed by all interviewees. Two new key barriers to patient enrolment were identified, that is, insufficient attention to the importance of clinical trial-based research in medical training and a trust gap between PIs and pharmaceutical representatives. A third important barrier was increasingly narrow patient inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: The success rate of patient enrolment in phase III cancer clinical trials highly depends on the clinicians' willingness to take part in clinical trials. Raising awareness of the importance of clinical trials in medical training and among practising oncologists is recommended. Furthermore, to reduce barriers to patient enrolment, it is essential that both clinicians and pharmaceutical representatives acknowledge each other's expertise, become acquainted with each other's procedures and regulations, and work on building trust relationships. Finally, in accordance with our key findings, we propose to add two new barriers to our newly developed conceptual framework; insufficient attention to clinical trial research in medical training and trust gap.</p>","Ashraf, S.S.

https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-9-527-2012,Biomass burning emissions estimated with a global fire assimilation system based on observed fire radiative power,"The Global Fire Assimilation System (GFASv1.0) calculates biomass burning emissions by assimilating Fire Radiative Power (FRP) observations from the MODIS instruments onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. It corrects for gaps in the observations, which are mostly due to cloud cover, and filters spurious FRP observations of volcanoes, gas flares and other industrial activity. The combustion rate is subsequently calculated with land cover-specific conversion factors. Emission factors for 40 gas-phase and aerosol trace species have been compiled from a literature survey. The corresponding daily emissions have been calculated on a global 0.5° &times; 0.5° grid from 2003 to the present. General consistency with the Global Fire Emission Database version 3.1 (GFED3.1) within its accuracy is achieved while maintaining the advantages of an FRP-based approach: GFASv1.0 makes use of the quantitative information on the combustion rate that is contained in the FRP observations, and it detects fires in real time at high spatial and temporal resolution. GFASv1.0 indicates omission errors in GFED3.1 due to undetected small fires. It also exhibits slightly longer fire seasons in South America and North Africa and a slightly shorter fire season in Southeast Asia. GFASv1.0 has already been used for atmospheric reactive gas simulations in an independent study, which found good agreement with atmospheric observations. We have performed simulations of the atmospheric aerosol distribution with and without the assimilation of MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD). They indicate that the emissions of particulate matter need to be boosted by a factor of 2-4 to reproduce the global distribution of organic matter and black carbon. This discrepancy is also evident in the comparison of previously published top-down and bottom-up estimates. For the time being, a global enhancement of the particulate matter emissions by 3.4 is recommended. Validation with independent AOD and PM10 observations recorded during the Russian fires in summer 2010 show that the global Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Change (MACC) aerosol model with GFASv1.0 aerosol emissions captures the smoke plume evolution well when organic matter and black carbon are enhanced by the recommended factor. In conjunction with the assimilation of MODIS AOD, the use of GFASv1.0 with enhanced emission factors quantitatively improves the forecast of the aerosol load near the surface sufficiently to allow air quality warnings with a lead time of up to four days. © 2012 Author(s).","van der Werf, G.R.",Biogeosciences,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

This study provides insight into the role of governance structures in interfirm cooperation and their effects on biotechnological product innovation and company success. Most of the existing literature regarding alliances and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) examines their effects on technology recipients' innovation performance. Here, the effects of alliances and M&A on both the innovation success and financial performance of technology suppliers (i.e., sources) are examined. Drawing from a sample of 220 human therapeutic biotechnology and biopharmaceutical firms over a period of 32 years (1980-2011), an analysis of the effects of biotechnology clusters, strategic alliances, and acquisitions is provided. This study reveals the existence of a risk-return trade-off for strategic alliances between biotech companies and larger, more established firms. Increased biotech company involvement in product development alliances decreases risk by increasing the likelihood of future product introductions. The trade-off, however, is that biotech companies earn lower returns when their products are developed through such alliances. A similar risk-return trade-off effect is found for clusters. However, acquisitions generally affect both product introductions and product returns in a negative way. These findings have strategic implications not only for managing the development of biotechnological product innovations and technology platforms but also for commercialization strategies with respect to interfirm cooperation and risk reduction.","Fernald, K.D.S.

In this paper, we question how the blogging practices of development professionals shape such ICT4D discourse. Through a combination of interviews and analyses of blog contents, we examine two major purposes of blogging: reflecting upon development practices and engaging with a self-selected audience. Our analyses reveal that these two purposes were interwoven in ways that contributed to making bloggers' ICT4D discourse innovative but oriented towards a small community of peers rather than a larger audience. Through blogging, development professionals refined their expertise on ICT4D. As they did so, they also generated a personal speaker's corner that primarily attracted like-minded peers rather than promoting larger participation in ICT4D discourse. This research contributes to the emerging literature on social media practices by showing how blogging practices enable the formation of what a discourse is about, and by highlighting differences between perceived and actual levels of interactions between bloggers and their audience. The paper also adds to the ICT and development literatures by revealing that blogging practices can deepen ICT4D discourse, but that they do not necessarily enhance participation in development. Such insight is crucial for development professionals to develop realistic expectations of blogging for ICT4D. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Ltd.","Soekijad, M.

Although various business-financing options for micro-enterprises exist, little is known about whether these options affect such enterprises’ performance. This chapter aims to examine various business-financing options’ effects on micro-enterprises’ performance in Kisumu County, Kenya, i.e., this study’s tropical context. Based on a survey of 326 micro-enterprises, the data analyses suggest that limited evidence exists that business-financing options affect micro-enterprises’ performance. With some reservations, it should be noted that a positive relationship exists between personal financing and a firm’s sales growth. The same goes for personal financing of micro-enterprises and the increased amount that the micro-entrepreneur’s household spends on housing. Only with some reservations can it be concluded that a positive relationship exists between the two, respectively. In both situations, personal financing is compared with internal and external financing, respectively. Explanations for this limited evidence concerning various financing options’ effects on micro-enterprise performance are discussed, and future research directions are proposed.</p>","Eijdenberg, E.L.

Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of The International Association for Chinese Management Research.Although transforming economies offer many examples of business model innovation, they have been largely overlooked in academic research, with most studies focusing on what happens in developed countries. However, in their push to become innovation economies, transforming economies have become experimentation arenas for new ways of doing business. This special issue addresses the gap in business model innovation research in several ways. First, we develop a co-evolutionary framework in which we consider what type of business model innovation occurs in transforming economies (adoption, adaptation, or creation) and who the central players are (indigenous firms or MNEs). We show how, through business model innovation, indigenous firms have begun to challenge global industry leaders - despite not having the same resource advantages, proprietary technology, or market power - and we highlight the consequences of this for the domestic and global environment. Second, we discuss how the articles in this special issue advance research by contributing to a co-evolutionary perspective on business model innovation for a global and digital world. Third, to guide future research on business model innovation in the fascinating context of transforming economies we outline various directions that could build on our framework and the articles presented here.","Mihalache, R.O.",Management and Organization Review,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

We build theory on the process of business model innovation through a qualitative study that investigates how an established firm organizes for an emerging business model. Contrary to previous findings that presented spatial separation as the optimal structural approach for dealing with two competing business models, our findings indicate a need for recursive iterations between different modes of separated and integrated structures in line with the emergent nature of strategic intent toward the new business models. Our analyses reveal strategy formation to be a collective experimental learning process revolving around a number of alternative strategic intentions ranging from incremental evolution and transformation to complete replacement of the existing business model. Given the fundamental differences in the nature and requirements of those alternative intents, iterations between different structural modes and differing combinations proved to be crucial in enabling the organization to make transition to the new business model.</p>","Khanagha, S.",R and D Management,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

Through a bibliometric review, we find that the top researchers in fragment-based drug discovery have a high degree of collaboration and mobility across institutes. We then investigate which aspects of the ITN training program enable PhD students to gain these skills. We find that secondments, the short-term stays that students have in partner research institutes, are useful in preparing students to have both broad knowledge of drug discovery and specialization in their field of interest. Aside from imparting technical skills, we find that the collaborative environment in ITNs enables students to communicate better and to work effectively in teams. Doctoral students benefit by being exposed to relevant experiences that they can later apply as they navigate through the complex web of relationships and competencies in the industry. We conclude by recommending best practices to further improve ITNs in the training of future practitioners.","van der Sijde, P.

A narrative interpretation of CDM describes the chain from innovative activity at firms to increases in welfare and makes links to the policy environment. Filling in missing pieces of the innovation to productivity puzzle has a heavy data burden. The paper makes use of the micro moments database (MMD) that allows observing micro-level behavior and macro-level impacts of innovation and production in a large selection of European countries. Two examples are given of research using the MMD. First, we estimate a simplified system of innovation and production equations that can be applied to average firm choices and outcomes, as well as to industry or aggregate outcomes. We find that innovative activity contributes to aggregate productivity even while the average effect at the firm level is insignificant. Next, a cross-country exploration is made that shows heightened productivity effects of combined use by firms of various enterprise-level information and communications technologies.","Bartelsman, E.J.",Economics of Innovation and New Technology,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2005.09.003,Characterizing the technology firm,"<p>Technology firms occupy a central position in modern economies. They drive economic growth, productivity gains and have created new industries and innovative products. Many will agree that technology firms are distinguished from others in their emphasis on technological activities. Since this observation is too general, researchers suggested a variety of specific criteria and definitions. A number of definitions of technology firms appear in the literature but many are arbitrary and simplistic and none gained wide acceptance. Similarly, the number of characteristics suggested is large, reflecting a variety of perspectives and interests. In this case too no agreement exists as to which are the important ones. Also, many seem to be interrelated capturing different aspects of the same underlying concepts. This paper is concerned with the issue of definition and classification of technology firms. We demonstrate the usefulness of a different approach to the definition and classification problem. We rely on executives' evaluations of their firms' technology profile and level. An analysis of these evaluations reveals the underlying dimensions the executives used in making their judgments. We regard the dimensions we uncover as capturing the essence of technology firms and use them to classify the firms we study. The specific characteristics the executives used to evaluate their firms were derived from a systematic scan of the literature. Thus, the list represents the set of characteristics early researchers viewed as describing and defining technology firms. The connection to early work enhances our findings' validity and lends some credence to our belief that the three dimensions we uncover (R&D activities which are closely associated with a set of organizational elements and market conditions, product strategy, and corporate culture) can be used by others to define technology firms and classify firms according to their technology level. In our study we use these three dimensions to classify the firms studied. We show that the commonly used practice of classifying firms as high and low technology according to the industry to which they belong is flawed. Our goal in this study is not to offer a ""new"" or ""better"" definition and characterization of technology firms or to offer the ""best"" approach to the generation of the classification criteria. Rather, we demonstrate here the usefulness of a different approach to the problem. While our approach does suffer from limitations it has important advantages. We hope future studies will confirm not only the usefulness of our approach but also the general applicability of the specific criteria we identify in this study.</p>","Grinstein, A.",Research Policy,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

The chapter also analyses whether competitiveness in the Baltics is due to technological progress. Technological progress is considered to be an important source of competitiveness. Technological progress is generated by developing and diffusing new knowledge or new combinations of existing knowledge. The chapter provides an analysis of the science and technology systems in the Baltic countries to see whether they fulfill the other prerequisites for catching up.</p>","Lankhuizen, M.B.M.",,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

This paper investigates how firms can coordinate open innovation as a platform strategy for the development of complementary products by independent third parties. We draw on a qualitative case study of Philips Hue – a connected lighting platform for consumers with its variety of complementary products. We identify three increasingly complex ways in which independent complements connect to a focal platform. Our findings show that managing these connections requires a hybrid open innovation approach that combines arm’s length coordination, with a large number of complementors through open interfaces, and intensive bilateral collaboration, with a selected number of partners. Our findings demonstrate that complex interconnections across digital platforms and products lead to the management challenge of navigating an ‘ecology of platforms’, which warrants future research.","Tuertscher, P.R.

Setting:: Community, The Netherlands Methods:: Participants were 265 individuals living with SCI for at least 10 years, who were 18–35 at the onset of SCI, aged 28–65 at the time of the study and wheelchair-user. Scales for General and Health-related Internet use were developed. Results:: Nearly all (97.7%) participants had Internet access and 98.4% of those used it daily or weekly. Of those with tetraplegia, 47.4% had assistive devices for computer use. General Internet use, such as following news and online banking, was very frequent. Websites with information on general health or accessibility were typically visited a few times a year. Three-quarters never visited websites of other individuals with SCI or foreign websites with information on SCI. General Internet use was associated with male gender, younger age, and higher education. Participants with tetraplegia scored higher on Health-related Internet use compared to participants with paraplegia. Health-related Internet use was associated with worse participation, but not with the other psychosocial variables. Conclusion:: Internet has become part of daily life of people with SCI in the Netherlands. However, only one association between Internet use and indicators of psychosocial functioning was found. Possible underuse of adaptive devices and of SCI-specific websites warrant further investigation.</p>","Janssen, T.W.J.",Spinal Cord,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

Exploratory results reveal several major impediments to linking commodification efforts with the consultancy and suggest the importance of internal legitimation efforts before market launch. The findings indicate the importance of considering the process in which management ideas gain 'good currency' within the system of knowledge supply.

In the creative domain knowledge reuse is a common practice known as “remixing”. With the emergence of open internet-based platforms in recent years, remixing has found its way from the world of music and art to the design of arbitrary physical goods. However, despite its obvious relevance for the number and quality of innovations on such platforms, little is known about the process of remixing and its contextual factors. This paper considers the example of Thingiverse, a platform for the 3D printing community that allows its users to create, share, and access a broad range of printable digital models. We present an explorative study of remixing activities that took place on the platform over the course of six years by using an extensive set of data on models and users. On the foundation of these empirically observed phenomena, we formulate a set of theoretical propositions and managerial implications regarding (1) the role of remixes in design communities, (2) the different patterns of remixing processes, (3) the platform features that facilitate remixes, and (4) the profile of the remixing platform’s users.","Friesike, S.C.",Journal of Information Technology,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

In many cases, assembly into higher-order structures is a prerequisite for protein function. Under conditions relevant for applications, protein integrity is often challenged, resulting in disassembly, aggregation, and loss of function. The stabilization of quaternary structure has proven challenging, particularly for trimeric and higher-order complexes, given the complexity of involved inter- and intramolecular interaction networks. Here, we describe the chemical bicyclization of homotrimeric protein complexes, thereby increasing protein resistance toward thermal and chemical stress. This approach involves the structure-based selection of cross-linking sites, their variation to cysteine, and a subsequent reaction with a triselectrophilic agent to form a protein assembly with bicyclic topology. Besides overall increased stability, we observe resistance toward aggregation and greatly prolonged shelf life. This bicyclization strategy gives rise to unprecedented protein chain topologies and can enable new biotechnological and biomedical applications.</p>","Hutchins, G.H.A.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jom.2018.10.004,Creativity and productivity in product design for additive manufacturing,"<p>The present study explores the phenomenon of remixing in product design for additive manufacturing (AM). In contrast to other manufacturing techniques, AM offers unprecedented flexibility in adapting existing product designs to changing requirements. However, in order to benefit from this potential, structured design procedures and tools are indispensable. As a possible solution, online platforms for collaborative 3D model creation are increasingly implementing features for remixing, a concept describing the creation of new models on the foundation of existing design elements. Against this backdrop, the objective of this research is to provide evidence for the value of remixing as an organizational intervention for improving product design processes. To this end, we present a mixed methods approach using data from Thingiverse, the world's largest AM-related online community. In a first step, we investigate qualitative data from 81 individual remix-based designs to identify the underlying mechanisms of remixing. We identify six such mechanisms that can further be grouped by the intended outcome of the respective process (creativity-oriented: inspiration, play, learning; productivity-oriented: speed, improvement, empowerment). In a second step, we turn to a quantitative analysis of platform data, which indicates that remixing may lead to better design process outcomes in terms of quantity and diversity of designs. Furthermore, we find that designs created by remixing designers are significantly more often printed by community members suggesting that remixing helps ensure manufacturing compatibility akin to continuous process improvement. Our research has several implications for individual designers and organizations engaging with product design for AM.</p>","Friesike, S.C.",Journal of Operations Management,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

Whereas existing literature on the topic views equality as underscoring the importance of distributive justice, power, or identity, the role of culture remains relatively obscure. In this study, the authors explore equality as a dynamic construct associated with two major processes in mergers of equals: cultural clash and cultural construction. The authors employ a qualitative case study with interviews and analysis of company materials from BroadBand, a wireless Internet access provider, to address the role of culture and equality in mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The results shed light on how and why social actors entering into mergers may enact a culture of equality. First, firms may develop new aspirations and patterns of appreciation and initiate practices and strategies that construct equality as an integral part of the merger. Second, when distributive equality becomes a liability, it incites change. In the context of equality, this change results in strategic action that transforms the meaning of ""a merger of equals"" to a more practical, pragmatic, and integrative equality, which takes into account the interests and the needs of the merged firm. Third, contrary to the common skeptical and cynical portrayal of mergers of equals, this study found equality to be a crucial factor during postmerger integration.</p>","Drori, I.",Human Resource Management,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

Today, a number of theoretical arguments illuminate users’ privacy rationales, including the privacy calculus, privacy literacy, and contextual differentiations. A recent approach focuses on user resignation, apathy, or fatigue. In this piece, we concentrate on privacy cynicism, an attitude of uncertainty, powerlessness, mistrust, and resignation toward data handling by online services that renders privacy protection subjectively futile. We discuss privacy cynicism in the context of data capitalism, as a coping mechanism to address the tension between digital inclusion and a desire for privacy. Moreover, we introduce a measure for privacy cynicism and investigate the phenomenon based on a large-scale survey in Germany. The analysis highlights the multidimensionality of the construct, differentiating its relationships with privacy concerns, threat experience, Internet skills, and protection behavior.</p>","Ranzini, G.",New Media and Society,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"
https://doi.org/10.1108/JOE-12-2012-0058,Decision-making as performative struggle: Strategic political-executive practices influencing the actualization of an infrastructural development,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to introduce the concept of performative struggle through the use of an interpretative case story focussed on a strategic decision-making process concerning infrastructural development. Performativity is about “world-making” (Carter et al., 2010), based on the assumption that conceptual schemes are not only prescriptions of the world, for the practices flowing from these abstract ideas bring into being the world they are describing. The focus on agency and multiplicity in the academic debate on performativity in organizational settings are combined, resulting in the conceptualization of a multitude of performative agents struggling to make the world. Design/methodology/approach – The methodological approach of this paper is based on an interpretative analysis of contrasting narratives that are told by political-executives in a strategic decision-making process. These narratives are based on in-depth interviews and participant observation. The interpretative case story, exhibiting the strategic decision-making practices of Aldermen, Delegates and Ministers – focusses on the moments of performative struggle based on strategic narrative practices. Findings – The interpretative case story will exhibit the way in which a multiplicity of agents reflects on the performative dimension of the decision-making process, anticipates on its performative effects and attempts to manipulate the strategic vision that is actualized into reality. Moreover, the agents are not primarily concerned with the actualization of a specific infrastructural project; they are more concerned with the consequences of decision making for their more comprehensive strategic visions on reality. Research limitations/implications – The notion of performative struggle has not yet been explicitly studied by scholars focussing on performativity. However, the concept can be used as an appropriate lens for studying meaning making within ethnographic studies on organizational processes such as for instance culture change intervention and strategy formation. The concept of performative struggle is especially useful for understanding the political dimension of meaning making when studying an organizational life-world through the use of ethnographic research. Originality/value – The originality of this paper lies in the innovative conceptualization of struggle between a multiplicity of reflexive agents in the debate on performative world-making. Moreover, the incorporation of the perspective of performative struggle within organizational ethnographic research is valuable for the development of organizational ethnographic methodology.","Merkus, S.

The contribution of tourism to the Greek economy has proved especially relevant during the period of the credit and Euro crises with a high budgetary and balance of payment deficits. From that perspective, this study examines the impact of the socio-economic and geographical determinants of foreign tourism demand in Greece. For the empirical analysis, a panel dataset of 31 countries is used over the period 2001-2010. The panel data estimation indicates that distance and trade have more explanatory power than relative prices and other determinants such as transport infrastructure. Income is statistically significant in three out of the eight specifications. Also, political stability seems to play an important role in tourism demand. The results are mixed for the competitive prices between Greece and its main tourism competitors. An interesting finding is that the Olympic Games of 2004 seem to have had a negative impact on international tourist arrivals in Greece in that year.

We derive under which lottery probabilities more divergent demand lotteries positively or negatively affect the decision to start R & D. Using CIS IV data for about 2600 German firms, we find that for firms facing lotteries where the good state is more likely to prevail a 10% increase in the degree of divergence of the demand lottery increases the likelihood of undertaking R & D by 1.2 percentage points. For firms facing a demand lottery where the bad state is most likely to prevail, a 10% increase in the degree of divergence of the demand lottery decreases the likelihood of undertaking R & D by 4.6 percentage points.

WAC is a care coordination method targeting families with complex needs. The core components of WAC involve activating family members and the social network, integrating the care provider network, and assessing, planning and evaluating the care process. WAC was introduced in the Netherlands using two approaches: the network approach (NA) and the team approach (TA). Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a digital questionnaire targeted at care providers. After imputation of missing data, univariate and multilevel regression analyses were conducted to study the associations between adherence to the core components of WAC, the determinants of adherence and background characteristics. Results: In total 145 out of 275 care providers (52.7%) responded to the questionnaire. Multilevel regression analysis showed that self-efficacy of the care providers and the way WAC is organised (NA versus TA region) were significantly associated with adherence to core components of WAC. Self-efficacy was significantly associated with all WAC core components (activating family members and the social network: β (95% confidence interval, CI) =.27(.04-.50), integrating the network of care providers: β (95% CI) =.27(.05-.50) and assessing, planning and evaluating the care process: β (95% CI) =.30(.08-.52)).

Conclusion: The way WAC is organised and the self-efficacy of care providers who use WAC are factors that are relevant for the redesign of the strategy for introducing WAC.

Understanding the determinants involved in successful radical drug innovations is key to increasing this type of output in the future. The objective of this review is to search the literature for key firm-level determinants of radical drug innovation. Following a systematic literature review approach, we considered more than 4100 peer-reviewed journal articles and PhD theses, of which we included 38 in the narrative synthesis. To guide the review, we use Crossan and Apaydin’s (J Manag Stud 47:1154–1191, 2010) model of firm-level determinants of innovation for the first time within the pharmaceutical industry, which is unique due to the risks, costs, and time frames associated with radical drug innovation. We focus on three groups of determinants: leadership, managerial levers, and business processes. We find the following to be particularly important for radical drug innovation: external knowledge sourcing (managerial lever); internal knowledge management (managerial lever); ability of top leaders to innovate, as determined by educational background and professional experience (leadership); and leaders’ focus on shaping innovation and performance cultures (leadership). We offer a conceptual framework of critical determinants of radical drug innovation and highlight managerial implications. We also discuss gaps in radical drug innovation research and provide suggestions for future study. Many of the findings discussed in this paper are contradictory because they rely on different definitions and measures, which inhibits our full and accurate understanding of radical drug innovation development.

A recent update of the International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) emphasised patient involvement during PtDA development, but omitted a methodology for doing so. This article reports on the value of user-centred design (UCD) methods for the development of a PtDA that aims to support inflammatory arthritis patients in their choice between disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).</p><p>METHODS: The IPDAS development process model in combination with UCD methods were applied. The process was overseen by an eight-member multidisciplinary steering group. Patients and health professionals were iteratively consulted. Qualitative in-depth interviews combined with rapid prototyping were conducted with patients to assess their needs for specific functionality, content and design of the PtDA. Group meetings with health professionals were organized to assess patients' needs and to determine how the PtDA should be integrated into patient pathways. The current literature was reviewed to determine the clinical evidence to include in the PtDA. To evaluate usability among patients, they were observed using the PtDA while thinking aloud and then interviewed.</p><p>RESULTS: The combination of patient interviews with rapid prototyping revealed that patients wanted to compare multiple DMARDs both for their clinical aspects and implications for daily life. Health professionals mainly wanted to refer patients to a reliable, easily adjustable source of information about DMARDs. A web-based PtDA was constructed consisting of four parts: 1) general information about SDM, inflammatory arthritis and DMARDs; 2) an application to compare particular DMARDs; 3) value clarification exercises; and 4) a printed summary of patients' notes, preferences, worries and questions that they could bring to discuss with their rheumatologist.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that UCD methods can be of great value for the development of PtDAs. The early, iterative involvement of patients and health professionals was helpful in developing a novel user-friendly PtDA that allowed patients to choose between DMARDs. The PtDA fits the values of all stakeholders and easily integrates with the patient pathway and daily workflow of health professionals.

https://doi.org/10.2196/jmir.2229,Differences in reach and attrition between Web-based and print-delivered tailored interventions among adults over 50 years of age: clustered randomized trial,"Background: The Internet has the potential to provide large populations with individual health promotion advice at a relatively low cost. Despite the high rates of Internet access, actual reach by Web-based interventions is often disappointingly low, and differences in use between demographic subgroups are present. Furthermore, Web-based interventions often have to deal with high rates of attrition. Objective: This study aims to assess user characteristics related to participation and attrition when comparing Web-based and print-delivered tailored interventions containing similar content and thereby to provide recommendations in choosing the appropriate delivery mode for a particular target audience. Methods: We studied the distribution of a Web-based and a print-delivered version of the Active Plus intervention in a clustered randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants were recruited via direct mailing within the participating Municipal Health Council regions and randomized to the printed or Web-based intervention by their region. Based on the answers given in a prior assessment, participants received tailored advice on 3 occasions: (1) within 2 weeks after the baseline, (2) 2 months after the baseline, and (3) within 4 months after the baseline (based on a second assessment at 3 months). The baseline (printed or Web-based) results were analyzed using ANOVA and chi-square tests to establish the differences in user characteristics between both intervention groups. We used logistic regression analyses to study the interaction between the user characteristics and the delivery mode in the prediction of dropout rate within the intervention period. Results: The printed intervention resulted in a higher participation rate (19%) than the Web-based intervention (12%). Participants of the Web-based intervention were significantly younger (P<.001), more often men (P=.01), had a higher body mass index (BMI) (P=.001) and a lower intention to be physically active (P=.03) than participants of the printed intervention. The dropout rate was significantly higher in the Web-based intervention group (53%) compared to the print-delivered intervention (39%, P<.001). A low intention to be physically active was a strong predictor for dropout within both delivery modes (P<.001). The difference in dropout rate between the Web-based and the printed intervention was not explained by user characteristics. Conclusions: The reach of the same tailored physical activity (PA) intervention in a printed or Web-based delivery mode differed between sociodemographic subgroups of participants over 50 years of age. Although the reach of the Web-based intervention is lower, Web-based interventions can be a good channel to reach high-risk populations (lower PA intention and higher BMI). While the dropout rate was significantly higher in the Web-based intervention group, no specific user characteristics explained the difference in dropout rates between the delivery modes. More research is needed to determine what caused the high rate of dropout in the Web-based intervention.","van Stralen, M.M.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

Can we use it in practice?,"<p>Insomnia is a common sleep disorder which has a 5–6% prevalence rate and shows high social impact. At least 10% of patients with insomnia will see a medical specialist. Hence, 20,000–40,000 people in Georgia require medical help for insomnia. Treatment of insomnia is very effective. Pharmacotherapy is common, but it is recognized that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a better choice, since it is safe for patients and shows sustainable improvement. CBT of insomnia is not currently available in Georgia. The aim of our study was to evaluate a Georgian version of an innovative, internet-delivered digital CBT (dCBT) for insomnia in terms of therapeutic efficacy, adherence, and ease of handling. The Georgian digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia was developed as an analogue of Dutch dCBT “i-Sleep.” All online materials were made applicable for the Georgian population through translation, validation by translation back to the original language, and adaptation to the Georgian reality, in order to avoid linguistic, cultural, and social pitfalls. Fifty-two adult patients with insomnia were recruited for the study: 34 women and 18 men, aged 18–64 years (mean: 33.5 years). Inclusion criteria included: age over 18, access to internet, and sufficient skills to use electronic devices. The patients who were treated pharmacologically continued their usual medication and received dCBT in addition to this treatment. DCBT was guided by a therapist. Clinical efficacy was evaluated on the basis of Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), measured before the dCBT and one month after its completion. 25 out of 52 patients (48%) completed a full dCBT course. Mean ISI in this group dropped from 22.88 to 8.24 (P < 0.01), showing significant therapeutic effect one month after CBT completion. 27 patients (52%) stopped treatment for various reasons at different stages of dCBT. Sixteen patients dropped out from the first module (31%). 7 patients older than 50 years encountered problems with handling electronic devices and the platform itself. 9 patients stopped therapy, showing bad adherence for different reasons, mostly related to finding the sessions time-consuming and being disappointed by the absence of immediate therapeutic effect. Eleven more patients (21%) stopped at sleep restriction, finding it difficult to accomplish sleep restriction-related tasks. In general, patients found dCBT quite comprehensive and easy to handle. This data suggests that the Georgian version of dCBT for insomnia is a promising therapeutic tool, comparable with international analogues in terms of efficacy and adherence. Further studies, involving a greater number of patients and long-term follow-up are required for the final assessment of therapeutic efficacy and sustainability of results.</p>","van Straten, A.",Internet Interventions,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

https://doi.org/10.1111/radm.12530,Disruption by design? Classification framework for the archetypes of disruptive business models,"<p>The current scholarly debates highlight the role of business models for understanding the dynamics inherent to disruptive innovations. Additionally, research on business models argues for similarities between business models, as they are shared by multiple competitors and across industries. Despite the recent advancements in both debate streams, a consolidation of the research on the underlying similarities of disruptive business models is lacking. Such a consolidation would allow learning from previous waves of disruption, ultimately informing theory and practice to cope with the increasing pace and impact of disruptive innovations. Consequently, this study systematically identifies 122 disruptive business models that have been discussed in the literature during 2006–2019. Based on qualitative content analysis, we then develop a classification framework and propose five archetypes of disruptive business models: (1) matchmakers, (2) standardizers, (3) service providers, (4) open collaborators, and (5) performance reducers. We make a twofold contribution to the discussions around the hitherto tentatively specified business models underlying disruptive innovations, thus emphasizing the contingency of the phenomenon. First, we discuss how the identified archetypes are inducing disruptive dynamics. Second, we elaborate on how the archetypes are constituting paths towards disruption.</p>","van der Sijde, P.",R&D Management,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

Examining the launch of 12 platform technologies in the U.S. videogame industry covering three console generations from 1993 until 2010, we show that incumbents introducing next‐generation platform technologies with advanced capabilities increase the challenges of developing complements for the platform technology, steepening complementors' learning curves and disrupting the very same complementors that platform owners need to thrive in the next‐generation competition. We find that, because of these struggles, platforms with advanced capabilities but high complement‐development challenges show a pattern of defection of complementors toward rival, less challenging platforms. Our study extends mainstream disruptive‐innovation theory to the context of platform‐based ecosystems by offering a systemic view that accounts for disaffection on the part of technology complementors—rather than end users—as the main reason for disruption.","Özalp, H.",Journal of Management Studies,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

We first analyze the separate influence of commodity prices on the Canadian and the U.S. currency components. We then estimate the separate impact of the two currency components on the shares of manufacturing employment in Canada. We show that between 33 and 39 per cent of the manufacturing employment loss that was due to exchange rate developments between 2002 and 2007 is related to the Dutch disease phenomenon.

We provide new evidence of this association by analysing a sample of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating in 25 developed and developing European countries. We find that financing constraints increase with foreign banks for those SMEs operating in countries where the share of banking assets owned by foreign banks is above 34%. Our results also show that borrower discouragement may decrease, or increase less, with the presence of foreign banks for SMEs operating in countries with high income, with cheap debt enforcement mechanisms, or having a private bureau that provides credit information about firms and individuals.

Aggregate evidence clearly shows falling employment accompanying the rise in productivity. In this paper, we examine the microeconomic evidence using the plant level data from the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD). In contrast to the conventional wisdom, we find that plants that increased employment as well as productivity contribute almost as much to overall productivity growth in the 1980s as the plants that increased productivity at the expense of employment. Further, there are striking differences by sector (defined by industry, size, region, wages, and ownership type) in the allocation of plants in terms of whether they upsize or downsize and whether they increase or decrease productivity. Nevertheless, in spite of the striking differences across sectors defined in a variety of ways, most of the variance of productivity and employment growth is accounted for by idiosyncratic factors.</p>","Bartelsman, E.J.",Small Business Economics,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

A key feature of our analysis is that we combine a cross-country perspective with a high level of sectoral detail, covering 49 sectors. Particularly innovative is our evaluation of energy intensity developments in a wide range of Service sectors. We find that across sectors, energy intensity levels in the Netherlands on average decreased only marginally, and increased in Services. This performance is in general worse than the OECD average, especially between 1987 and 1995. Changes in the sectoral composition of the economy play an important role in explaining aggregate trends. In the Manufacturing sector, about half of the efficiency improvements were undone by a shift towards a more energy-intensive industry structure.

Cross-sectional data from the Community Innovation Survey of German companies is used to test hypotheses with regard to this effect. Results from PLS-SEM analyses show that sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring capabilities all have a significant direct effect on innovation towards sustainability, with sensing activities playing the most prominent role. It is also found that reconfiguring capabilities positively influence sensing as well as seizing capabilities, and that sensing and seizing capabilities partially mediate the relationship between reconfiguring capabilities and companies’ sustainable innovation. This research extends the current literature by investigating how companies could build-up and shape their dynamic capabilities and organizational routines for sustainable innovation.

We find that the shift towards a service economy has contributed to lower overall energy intensity levels in the OECD, but this contribution would have been considerably larger if the service sector had realized the same degree of energy efficiency improvements as the manufacturing sector. In most OECD countries energy intensity levels in services tend to decrease relatively slow, especially after 1995. If we control this trend for the impact of structural changes within the services sector - by means of a decomposition analysis - we find that in about one-third of the OECD countries, energy intensity levels in services have increased over time. The impact of structural changes on aggregate energy intensity dynamics in services has increased considerably after 1995, highlighting a relatively poor energy efficiency performance within a wide range of service sectors. We show that the introduction of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) plays a potentially important role here.

In this paper we seek to answer how infrastructures became novel arenas of political conflict in Greece. We suggest that crucial for understanding this process is the dynamic relationship between infrastructures and popular political imaginaries. During the recent ‘golden’ period of infrastructural development in the country (mid-1990s to mid-2000s) there was a mutually constitutive relationship between popular imaginations of progress and the materiality of infrastructures, which attempted to underplay the disjunctive modernization processes within which that development took place. Later though, this parallel relationship between the two was contested as the infrastructural imaginary, which was transformed by the everyday discourses and practices created around infrastructure projects, blurred the expectations and imagination ascribed to the ‘glorious’ period of national success and modernization. In combination with the infrastructural gap of the crisis, the narrative dimension started taking over the materiality of infrastructures allowing it to take on a life of its own. Understanding the mechanisms of this relationship between imaginary and infrastructural materiality is key to comprehending the Greek economic crisis without a crisis essentialism that attributes every process into the crisis per se.</p>","Kallianos, I.

Based on a survey amongst 1,535 SMEs, we show that the presence of growth capability factors, such as, innovation capacity, financing capacity and human capital, offers inadequate explanation for differences in the level of growth between SMEs in a specific period of time. The utilisation of different growth paths however does seem to elucidate differences between low and high growth. Remarkably, we found that growth paths that are most commonly used by SMEs (market penetration and increasing efficiency) hardly lead to growth. Rather growth paths that are infrequently utilised like setting up a new additional venture and entering foreign markets lead to significantly higher growth levels. It seems however that these growth paths are not attainable for SMEs due to the more extensive investments required. Increasing the firms’ brand awareness was found to be the only path to growth that was both used frequently and that yields actual growth. Therefore, investing in this path to growth seems to be a sensible investment choice for SMEs that want to grow.","Wakkee, I.A.M.",Journal of Entrepreneurship,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

For engineering purposes, there is a need for very simple, explicit, yet accurate, models that predict the performance of WLANs under anticipated load conditions. In this context, several detailed packet-level models have been proposed, based on fixed-point equations. Despite the fact that these models generally lead to accurate performance predictions, they do not lead to simple explicit expressions for the performance of WLANs. Motivated by this, we propose a new analytic model that captures the highly complex combined dynamics and protocol overhead of the 802.11 MAC, IP, TCP and application-layer into an explicit expression for a single parameter which will be called the effective service time. Based on the effective service time, we define the effective load to describe the flow-level performance of file transfers over WLANs with an M/G/1 Processor Sharing (PS) model. Using the M/G/1 PS model properties we propose a simple analytic model to obtain WLAN AP buffer content distribution. Despite the fact that PS models are heavily used in modelling flow-level performance in communication networks, an extensive validation of such models has not been published in the field, or context, of WLAN. To this end, our model is validated extensively by comparing the model-based average response times against simulations. The results show that the model leads to highly accurate predictions over a wide range of parameter combinations, including light- and heavy-tailed file-size distributions and light- and heavy-load scenarios. The simplicity and accuracy of the model make the results of high practical relevance and useful for performance engineering purposes. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In order to bridge the gap between initial contact and the beginning of psychotherapy, web-based interventions can be applied. The implementation of a web-based depression intervention during waiting periods has the potential to reduce depressive symptoms and enhance well-being in depressive individuals waiting for psychotherapy. Methods: In a two-arm randomized controlled trial, effectiveness and acceptance of a guided web-based intervention for depressive individuals on a waitlist for psychotherapy are evaluated. Participants are recruited in several German outpatient clinics. All those contacting the outpatient clinics with the wish to enter psychotherapy receive study information and a depression screening. Those adults (age≥18) with depressive symptoms above cut-off (CES-D scale >22) and internet access are randomized to either intervention condition (treatment as usual and immediate access to the web-based intervention) or waiting control condition (treatment as usual and delayed access to the web-based intervention).

Methods A cluster randomized stepped wedge trial was performed in a Dutch meat processing company from february 2012 until march 2015. In total 305 workers participated in the trial. Outcomes were retrieved during a WHS program, by multiple questionnaires, and from company registries. Primary outcomes were sickness absence, work ability, and productivity. Secondary outcomes were health, vitality, and psychosocial workload. Data were analyzed with linear and logistic multilevel models. Cost-benefit analyses from the employer's perspective were performed as well. Results Primary outcomes sickness absence (OR = 1.40), work ability (B = -0.63) and productivity (OR = 0.71) were better in the control condition. Secondary outcomes did not or minimally differ between conditions. Of the 12 secondary outcomes, the only outcome that scored better in the experimental condition was meaning of work (B = 0.18). Controlling for confounders did not or minimally change the results. However, our stepped wedge design did not enable adjustment for confounding in the last two periods of the trial.

The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of an online training program called Mental Health Online which consists of eight short e-learning modules, each capturing an important aspect of the process of recognition, guidance and referral of suicidal adolescents (12-20 years). The primary outcomes of this study are participant's ratings on perceived knowledge, perceived self-confidence, and actual knowledge regarding adolescent suicidality. Methods/Design: A randomized controlled trial will be carried out among 154 gatekeepers. After completing the first assessment (pre-test), participants will be randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the waitlist control group. One week after completing the first assessment the experimental group will have access to the website Mental Health Online containing the eight e-learning modules and additional information on adolescent suicide prevention. Participants in both conditions will be assessed 4 weeks after completing the first assessment (post-test), and 12 weeks after completing the post-test (follow-up).

Parents with high levels of distress are found to respond less adequately and sensitively to their infant, which in turn affects infant well-being and health. The goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a psycho-educational intervention to prevent postpartum parental distress and enhance the quality of caregiving and infant well-being. In contrast to other interventions, this intervention will be (1) offered already before birth, (2) offered to all parents-to-be, regardless of their risk of postpartum distress, and (3) include fathers. The proposed study examines the effectiveness of this intervention on (1) parenting distress, (2) quality of caregiving, and (3) the infant's well-being. Methods/design: In this randomized controlled trial, 128 pregnant women and their partners will be recruited through midwifery practices and general media. Women with a complicated pregnancy, current psychopathology, insufficient Dutch language proficiency and without Internet access will be excluded. Parents will be randomized to either the intervention or a waitlist control group. The intervention consists of a booklet and video (offered prenatally), a home visit at 34-36 weeks of pregnancy and a telephone call 4 weeks after birth. Information and practical tools are provided on (1) sensitive responding and making contact with the baby, (2) crying, (3) feeding, and (4) sleeping. Assessments will take place at baseline (26-34 weeks of pregnancy), during the home visit (34-36 weeks of pregnancy), and 2, 6, and 10 weeks after birth. The control group will be offered the intervention after the end of the study. The primary outcome is maternal parenting stress. Secondary outcomes are: paternal parenting stress, parental well-being, quality of caregiving, and infant well-being and health. Discussion: The goal of this study is to test the effects of a psycho-educational prenatal parenting intervention to prevent postpartum parental distress and to enhance well-being in both parents and infants. When the intervention appears effective it can be implemented broadly because of its low costs.

However, its complicated print process and post-treatments, such as sintering, are time consuming and sensitive to technical details. Therefore, the feasibility of using a high-speed sintering (HS) method for the fabrication of DLP-based zirconia was investigated in this study. Zirconia samples fabricated using DLP and conventional subtractive manufacturing techniques were all sintered following the different protocols: HS and conventional sintering (CS). Then, the density, Vickers hardness, fracture toughness, surface micro-topography, phase assemblage, and ageing resistance were assessed. The results showed that samples fabricated using the HS technique presented moderate Vickers hardness, fracture toughness, and ageing sensitivity in comparison with the other groups of specimens; moreover, they exhibited moderate initial cubic phase content and average grain size. Conversely, specimens sintered using the CS protocol with a peak temperature of 1580 °C showed high ageing sensitivity and unbalanced mechanical properties. The DLP- and SM-fabricated specimens showed similar trends for the studied properties. Overall, sintering parameters can significantly affect the macro- and micro-properties of DLP specimens, and the proposed HS method showed potential for producing DLP-based zirconia that is acceptable for clinical applications.</p>","Lu, Y.",Ceramics International,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

For this, ceramic blocks were fabricated with adhesive surface area of 5 × 5 mm to test the different possibilities combining the two different glass-ceramic compositions (feldspathic – FEL and lithium disilicate - LD), the three manufacturing-processes (CAD/CAM, heat-pressed or layered for FEL; CAD/CAM or heat-pressed for LD) and the two μTBS assemblies (ceramic-ceramic or ceramic-dentin). Half of the samples of each ceramic evaluated were made by cementing the ceramic blocks in another ceramic block and the other half by cementing the ceramic blocks in ground molars with exposed dentin, using resin cement (Rely X ARC, 3 M ESPE). The samples were stored for 24 h in distilled water at 37 °C and then sectioned into microbars (±1 mm<sup>2</sup>, n = 30). These specimens were submitted to the μTBS and the data were analyzed by specific statistical tests (α = 0.05). The fractured surfaces were examined under a stereomicroscope and the failure mode was classified. In addition, finite element analysis (FEA) was performed to observe the maximum tensile stress in the resin cement when a μTBS load was applied (10 N) and during the resin cement polymerization shrinkage. The CAD/CAM glass-ceramics have better bond strength than the other evaluated manufacturing processes, the LD groups had higher μTBS values than the FEL groups in ceramic-ceramic assembly; dentin as a substrate (ceramic-dentin assembly) had a negative influence on the results for all evaluated materials. Regarding the FEA results, the maximum tensile stress in ceramic-ceramic groups was 16.1–16.5 MPa (when 10 N load was simulated), and 50.8–51.2 MPa (during the resin cement polymerization shrinkage). For the ceramic-dentin groups, the maximum tensile stress was 16.9 and 17.1 MPa on the ceramic side and 17.6 and 17.8 MPa on the dentin side (10 N load simulation); 49.8 and 49.4 MPa on the ceramic side and 49.7 and 49.4 MPa on the dentin side (resin cement polymerization shrinkage). Different glass-ceramic compositions and manufacturing processes induced distinct bond strength values (LD had better results). Moreover, the μTBS assembly interferes with the results obtained, having the ceramic-ceramic set-up inducing higher bond results than the ceramic-dentin arrangement.</p>","de Jager, N.

Blocks of different CAD/CAM materials (Composites: KAV – Katana Avencia; LULT – LULT Ultimate; Ceramics: ENAM – Vita Enamic; NICE - N!CE; EMP – IPS Empress CAD; VMII – Vita Mark II; EMAX – IPS e.max CAD) were selected, and direct resin composite blocks (APX - Clearfil AP-X; FSUP - Filtek Supreme) were built using the incremental technique on a mold from one of the CAD/CAM blocks. All blocks were sectioned into bar-shaped specimens (1 × 1 × 14 mm), which were separated into two groups according to the region of the block (inside or outside). 3-point bending tests were performed following ISO 6872:2015 and flexural strength data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc tests (p < 0.05). Weibull module and characteristic strength were also calculated. In general, the mean flexural strength values were not statistically different (p > 0.05) between the inside and outside regions of each material, except for LULT (inside > outside) and EMAX (outside > inside). Comparing the materials, a similar strength (only discrete variations) was observed for inside, outside or merged (inside and outside data assembled together) regions: EMAX > KAV = LULT > NICE = APX > EMP = ENAM = VMII ≥ FSUP (merged condition). Characteristic strength at 63.2% failure probability and at 5% failure probability generally corroborates such observations. There were no statistical differences for Weibull module data (inside, outside, or merged), except for KAV and NICE (outside > inside). Thus, the region from where the restoration is milled within the CAD/CAM block generally does not influence the mechanical performance hereof (flexural strength, failure probability, risk of premature failures, and mechanical reliability) of the material, except for LULT and EMAX.</p>","de Kok, P.

The aim of this study was to estimate the efficacy of an on-line self-help intervention to reduce problem drinking at the population level. Design: On-line open randomized controlled trial with an 8-week intervention and an active control group (intervention n = 303, control n = 286). Assessments took place at baseline and at 6 months follow-up. Setting: On- and offline channels were used for population-based recruitment within a nation-wide prevention campaign in Estonia. Participants: Inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18 years, heavy drinking [Alcohol Use Disorders Identification (AUDIT) test score ≥ 8], literacy in Estonian and at least weekly access to the internet; n = 589 participants were randomized (50% male, 1% other; mean age 37.86 years; 45% with higher level of education). Intervention and comparator: The intervention consisted of 10 modules based on principles of cognitive–behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing. The active control group received access to a website with a self-test including personalized normative feedback and information for standard alcohol treatment. Measurements: The primary outcome was AUDIT scores at 6 months follow-up adjusted for baseline scores. Findings: Intention-to-treat analyses were applied. Missing data were addressed by using baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) and multiple imputation by chained equations (MI); 175 completed follow-up in the intervention group and 209 in the control group. AUDIT score at follow-up was significantly smaller in the intervention [BOCF mean = 13.91, standard deviation (SD) = 7.61, MI mean = 11.03, SD = 6.55] than control group (BOCF mean = 15.30, SD = 7.31; MI mean = 14.30, SD = 7.21), with a group difference of −1.38 [95% confidence interval (CI) = –2.58, –0.18], P = 0.02 for BOCF and −3.26 (95% CI = –2.01, –4.51), P < 0.001 for MI.

Compared to direct access to cloud resources, the use of intermediate surrogates improves system qualities such as response time, energy efficiency, and resilience. However, the state-of-the-art mostly focuses on introducing new architectural tactics rather than quantitatively comparing the existing tactics, which can help software architects and software engineers with new insights on each tactic.<br/><br/>Aim<br/>Our work aims at empirically evaluating the architectural tactics for surrogate provisioning, specifically with respect to resilience and energy efficiency.<br/><br/>Method<br/>We follow a systematic experimentation framework to collect relevant data on Static Surrogate Provisioning and Dynamic Surrogate Provisioning tactics.

This study suggests that the relational exchange norms of flexibility, information sharing, and solidarity (the bright side) encourage buyer innovation. However, negative (dark side) aspects of relationships with suppliers-loss of supplier objectivity, increasing buyer expectations, and supplier opportunism-may accompany the bright side and subsequently reduce buyer innovation. The study reports on the simultaneous effects of the bright and dark sides on innovation and the resultant effect on supplier performance as evaluated from the buyer's perspective. Using data from the travel and computer industry, regression models reveal that the bright side encourages buyer innovation. Buyers reciprocate this support by enhancing their supplier evaluations. The findings indicate that rising buyer expectations-supposedly a dark side of relational exchange-encourage innovation, while loss of supplier objectivity reduces relationship performance.

Since software is becoming the central focus of modern robotic systems, it is important to understand how it influences the energy consumption of the entire system. However, there is no systematic study of the state of the art in energy efficiency of robotics software that could guide research or practitioners in finding solutions and tools to develop robotic systems with energy efficiency in mind the goal of this paper is to present a review of existing research on energy efficiency in robotics software. Specifically, we investigate on (i) the used metrics for energy efficiency, (ii) the application domains within the robotics area covered by research on energy efficiency, (iii) the identified major energy consumers within a robotic system, (iv) how existing approaches are evaluated, (v) the used energy models, (vi) the techniques supporting the development of energy-efficient robotics software, and (vii) which quality attributes tend to be traded off when dealing with energy efficiency in robotics.

To facilitate this, and more fully harness the skill sets of both engineering and data science, Netflix engineers created a science-centric experimentation platform that leverages the expertise of scientists from a wide range of backgrounds working on data science tasks by allowing them to make direct code contributions in the languages used by them (Python and R). Moreover, the same code that runs in production is able to be run locally, making it straightforward to explore and graduate both metrics and causal inference methodologies directly into production services. In this paper, we provide two main contributions. Firstly, we report on the architecture of this platform, with a special emphasis on its novel aspects: how it supports science-centric end-to-end workflows without compromising engineering requirements.

Currently, the environmental sustainability of these frameworks is mainly derived from the application of efficiency principles such as waste reduction, or closing and narrowing production, and consumption loops. However, these same principles can bring, in some cases, unintended outcomes that are detrimental to the environment. Efficiency principles also fall short of environmental sustainability aspirations, doing little to contribute to addressing the causes of current global environmental crises. This paper examines 7 widely applicable principles aimed at explicit environmental sustainability: doing no harm to nature, minimising environmental damage, restoring/remediating environmental damage, net-positive impact, no net loss, maintaining the health of ecosystems, and continual environmental improvement. These principles could markedly improve efforts to actively pursue sustainability and foster new economic forms that address our current unsustainable trajectories.</p>","Morseletto, P.",Sustainability Science,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+2 more)"

Often motivated by optimization objectives, software products are characterized by different subsequent releases and deployed through different strategies. The impact of these two aspects of software on energy consumption has still to be completely understood and can be improved by carrying out ad-hoc analyses for specific software products. <br/><br/>Aims. In this research we report on an industrial collaboration aiming at assessing the different impact that releases and deployment strategies of a software product can have on the energy consumption of its underlying hardware infrastructure. <br/><br/>Method. We designed and performed an empirical experiment in a controlled environment. Deployment strategies, releases and use case scenarios of an industrial third-party software product were adopted as experimental factors. The use case scenarios were used as a blocking factor and adopted to dynamically load-test the software product. Power consumption and execution time were selected as response variables to measure the energy consumption. <br/><br/>Results. We observed that both deployment strategies and software releases significantly influence the energy consumption of the hardware infrastructure. A strong interaction between the two factors was identified. The impact of such interaction highly varied depending on which use case scenario was considered, making the identification of the most frequently adopted use case scenario critical for energy optimisation. The collaboration between industry and academia has been productive for both parties, even if some practitioners manifested low interest/awareness on software energy efficiency. <br/><br/>Conclusions. For the software product considered there is no absolute preferable release or deployment strategy with respect to energy efficiency, as the interaction of these factors has to be considered.

We investigated adaptations of the human macroscale brain network by comparing human brain wiring with that of the chimpanzee, one of our closest living primate relatives. White matter connectivity networks were reconstructed using diffusion-weighted MRI in humans (n = 57) and chimpanzees (n = 20) and then analyzed using network neuroscience tools. We demonstrate higher network centrality of connections linking multimodal association areas in humans compared with chimpanzees, together with a more pronounced modular topology of the human connectome. Furthermore, connections observed in humans but not in chimpanzees particularly link multimodal areas of the temporal, lateral parietal, and inferior frontal cortices, including tracts important for language processing. Network analysis demonstrates a particularly high contribution of these connections to global network integration in the human brain.

The concept of Open Innovation in Science (OIS) provides a framework that integrates dispersed research efforts aiming to understand the antecedents, contingencies, and consequences of applying open and collaborative research practices. While the OIS framework has already been taken up by science of science scholars, its conceptual underpinnings require further specification. In this essay, we critically examine the OIS concept and bring to light two key aspects: 1) how OIS builds upon Open Innovation (OI) research by adopting its attention to boundary-crossing knowledge flows and by adapting other concepts developed and researched in OI to the science context, as exemplified by two OIS cases in the area of research funding; 2) how OIS conceptualises knowledge flows across boundaries. While OI typically focuses on well-defined organisational boundaries, we argue that blurry and even invisible boundaries between communities of practice may more strongly constrain flows of knowledge related to openness and collaboration in science. Given the uptake of this concept, this essay brings needed clarity to the meaning of OIS, which has no particular normative orientation towards a close coupling between science and industry.

These top-carnivores can disrupt biological pest control by suppressing the populations of their parasitoid hosts, leading to pest outbreaks, especially in confined environments such as greenhouses where augmentative biological control is used. There is no effective eco-friendly strategy that can be used to control hyperparasitoids. Recent advances in the chemical ecology of hyperparasitoid foraging behavior have opened opportunities for manipulating these top-carnivores in such a way that biological pest control becomes more efficient. We propose various infochemical-based strategies to manage hyperparasitoids. We suggest that a push-pull strategy could be a promising approach to ‘push’ hyperparasitoids away from their parasitoid hosts and ‘pull’ them into traps. Additionally, we discuss how infochemicals can be used to develop innovative tools improving biological pest control (i) to restrict accessibility of resources (e.g. sugars and alternative hosts) to primary parasitoid only or (ii) to monitor hyperparasitoid presence in the crop for early detection. We also identify important missing information in order to control hyperparasitoids and outline what research is needed to reach this goal.

However, there is a limited research on these soft factors and how they influence companies performance and social outcomes on the one hand and how they enable the hard factors on the other hand. Taking this as a valuable opportunity, the purpose of this paper is to present the key motivating factors and key gaps in the literature as an agenda for future research. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic methodology to identifying the literature on social outcomes and factors in Lean is presented. Web of Science, EBSCO, Emerald, Science Direct, Google Scholar and the top journals were searched, and 158 papers were identified. Findings: The systematic review helped the authors to identify the evolution, current trends, research gaps and an agenda for future research for exploring social outcomes in Lean and the factors mediating them. These factors are grouped and presented. Practical implications: The implications of this work include understanding for managers and professionals how both soft and hard factors in Lean are related and that for a sustainable implementation, the whole system must be observed. This work could serve as a valuable resource that depending on the execution of Lean, either positive outcomes will emerge or even negative outcomes, referred to as “The Dark Side”.

Data were coded and analysed using the framework approach.</p><p>RESULTS: According to dietitians, the SMARTsize intervention had a positive influence on patients. The main implementation facilitators were the availability of implementation materials, such as a manual, training in relapse prevention and social support from other dietitians. The main barriers to implementation were organisation and financial reimbursement of cooking classes, the belief that patients need more individual counselling in the starting phase, and the unsuitability for people with low levels of health literacy.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS: Most dietitians considered that implementation of the SMARTsize intervention consisting of e-health, written information and cooking classes and face-to-face counselling is challenging but feasible. Further development of the SMARTsize intervention and implementation tools is needed to lower experienced barriers. It is also recommended that a version of the intervention to be developed that is suitable for patients with lower levels of health literacy.</p>","Kroeze, W.

Current research in the sector is rich with mathematical models that focus on this decision, although these models have a limited scope in terms of decision factors. Through a Delphi study our article investigates, identifies, and orders a comprehensive set of factors that decision makers in the humanitarian sector take into consideration when determining where to preposition inventory on the global level. Through this process, 10 main factors are identified, with the top five factors being required: speed of emergency response, the availability and quality of infrastructure, the availability and quality of business support services, the cost of operating the facility, and the availability and quality of labor. We also include suggestions for facility location research based on the outcomes of our study.","Dullaert, W.E.H.

The factors under investigation include knowledge of the natural/social environment, perception of threats to the natural/social environment, altruism towards others and entrepreneurial knowledge. We interviewed 220 owner-managers in the trading and service sector who supply goods and services to the mining industry in Zambia. We found that altruism towards others was partially supported by our empirical results while the positive effects of knowledge of the natural/social environment and perception of threats to the natural/social environment on the identification of sustainable opportunities were not supported. Contrary to our expectations, entrepreneurial knowledge does not positively moderate the relationship between explanatory variables and the identification of sustainable opportunities. In sum, we found only limited empirical support for the model of Patzelt and Shepherd (2011) concerning the identification of sustainable opportunities. Our findings contribute to literature on entrepreneurship and sustainable opportunity identification by showing what factors influence the identification of sustainable opportunities. This can help us to create awareness among entrepreneurs regarding the effects of entrepreneurial activities on the environment and society; consequently, stimulating entrepreneurs to identify sustainable opportunities.","Choongo, P.

Specimens of five dental ceramics (FC- feldspathic; PICN- polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network; ZLS- zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass-ceramic; LD-lithium disilicate glass-ceramic; YZ-yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal), to be tested under fatigue (12 × 12 × 1.2 mm<sup>3</sup>), were assigned into two groups according to surface treatment: polished ‘p’ (#2500-grit SiC papers) and CAD/CAM milling roughness simulation ‘gr’ (grinding with #60-grit SiC paper). The fatigue test was performed through the stepwise method (40N–660N; step of 20N; 10,000 cycles/step; 20 Hz frequency). Roughness, topographic and fractographic analyses were performed. The fatigue data were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and Mantel-Cox (Log rank), and Pearson correlation was used to correlate roughness vs. fatigue data. CAD/CAM milling roughness simulation led to significantly (p < 0.05) greater roughness (Ra and Rz), promoting a more irregular topography with scratches and grooves, and led to a lower fatigue performance for all the tested ceramics. Fractographic analysis depicted the origin of failure at the higher stress concentration side, the side subjected to tensile tension during the fatigue test. The CAD/CAM milling roughness simulation significantly decreased the fatigue performance of the evaluated ceramic materials.</p>","Werner, A.

These foods are often well-preserved and serve as stable and significant sources of proteins, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. Despite these common features, however, many differences exist with respect to substrates and products and the types of microbes involved in the manufacture of fermented foods and beverages produced globally. In this review, we describe these differences and consider the influence of geography and industrialization on fermented foods manufacture. Whereas fermented foods produced in Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand usually depend on defined starter cultures, those made in Asia and Africa often rely on spontaneous fermentation. Likewise, in developing countries, fermented foods are not often commercially produced on an industrial scale. Although many fermented products rely on autochthonous microbes present in the raw material, for other products, the introduction of starter culture technology has led to greater consistency, safety, and quality. The diversity and function of microbes present in a wide range of fermented foods can now be examined in detail using molecular and other omic approaches. The nutritional value of fermented foods is now well-appreciated, especially in resource-poor regions where yoghurt and other fermented foods can improve public health and provide opportunities for economic development. Manufacturers of fermented foods, whether small or large, should follow Good Manufacturing Practices and have sustainable development goals. Ultimately, preferences for fermented foods and beverages depend on dietary habits of consumers, as well as regional agricultural conditions and availability of resources.</p>","Kort, R.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0082609,Food-Pharma Convergence in Medical Nutrition - Best of Both Worlds?,"At present, industries within the health and life science sector are moving towards one another resulting in new industries such as the medical nutrition industry. Medical nutrition products are specific nutritional compositions for intervention in disease progression and symptom alleviation. Industry convergence, described as the blurring of boundaries between industries, plays a crucial role in the shaping of new markets and industries. Assuming that the medical nutrition industry has emerged from the convergence between the food and pharma industries, it is crucial to research how and which distinct industry domains have contributed to establish this relatively new industry. The first two stages of industry convergence (knowledge diffusion and consolidation) are measured by means of patent analysis. First, the extent of knowledge diffusion within the medical nutrition industry is graphed in a patent citation interrelations network. Subsequently the consolidation based on technological convergence is determined by means of patent co-classification. Furthermore, the medical nutrition core domain and technology interrelations are measured by means of a cross impact analysis. This study proves that the medical nutrition industry is a result of food and pharma convergence. It is therefore crucial for medical nutrition companies to effectively monitor technological developments within as well as across industry boundaries. This study further reveals that although the medical nutrition industry's core technology domain is food, technological development is mainly driven by pharmaceutical/pharmacological technologies Additionally, the results indicate that the industry has surpassed the knowledge diffusion stage of convergence, and is currently in the consolidation phase of industry convergence. Nevertheless, while the medical nutrition can be classified as an industry in an advanced phase of convergence, one cannot predict that the pharma and food industry segments will completely converge or whether the medical industry will become an individual successful industry. © 2013 Weenen et al.","Claassen, H.J.H.M.

In sessions on food security – the focus in developing countries – and food safety – primarily a preoccupation in developed countries – many potential trade-offs and opportunities for regional approaches were identified. The session on governance, therefore, focused on the interaction between multi-level actors, including national governments, international organisations such as WTO, the food industry and consumers. Finally, transparency was identified as one of the main issues underlying good governance.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s00168-012-0509-1,From Innovation to Commercialisation through Networks and Agglomerations,"This study claims that policy makers may not be sufficiently aware of the importance of maintaining an appropriate balance between exploration and exploitation networks for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). On the basis of the open innovation model, policy makers are also increasingly stimulating SMEs to develop their exploration skills. In the Netherlands, a government subsidy called the 'innovation voucher programme' was introduced to stimulate SMEs to develop innovation in cooperation with knowledge institutes. Yet, although many studies show that SMEs tend to have a higher R&D productivity than larger firms, and innovative SMEs are more likely to make external networks with other SMEs or institutions such as universities, there is still little examination of the successfulness of SME's innovation activities. The growing policy attention for the role of SMEs in innovation prompts the questions how innovation in SMEs can be facilitated, and which factors contribute to the success (or failure) of their innovation efforts. This study explores the innovation strategy of innovative Dutch SMEs by means of their sources of innovation, innovation capabilities, innovation performance, and commercialization sources. By means of structural equation modelling of a sample of 243 Dutch SMEs, this study shows that exploring (technology) opportunity together with institutions such as universities and private research establishments is important for successful innovation in SMEs. But, in addition, our model shows that contacts with competitors are also important for successful innovation performance. Our finding that openness of open innovation also applies to the commercialization phase is too often neglected by researchers and policy makers. © 2012 The Author(s).","Nijkamp, P.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.technovation.2022.102681,Game of skill or game of luck? Distant search in response to performance feedback,"<p>Despite its strategic benefits, there is persistent heterogeneity across firms to what extent they engage in distant search activities. According to the default prediction of behavioral theory of the firm (BTF), poor past performance will increase a firm's propensity for distant search, whereas good performance will lead to a decrease. However, a contrasting view is taken within the emerging capability cue perspective, which predicts the opposite. To understand these conflicting views, we emphasize the key role of context that is formed by a firm's sectoral innovation pattern and shapes the dominant cognition of firms' managers. Building on this sectoral innovation perspective and Pavitt's seminal work (1984; 1995) we distinguish between a science-based innovation pattern (here, we focus on the semiconductor industry) and a specialized-supplier innovation pattern (we focus on the machinery industry). The key claim we make is that different sectoral innovation patterns shape other dominant managerial cognitions, leading to a different interpretation of past performance that influences the decision to increase or decrease distant search. Our paper contributes to an understanding of how the competing ideas on different ways in which firms respond to feedback, in view of distant search, can be reconciled. We also contribute to the literature on technological innovation by considering the role of managerial cognition and how differences therein can be associated with different firm choices on their distant search activities.</p>","Gilsing, V.A.",Technovation,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

For this purpose, an Applied General Equilibrium (AGE) model consisting of 27 production sectors is extended to water through the inclusion of substitution elasticities between labour, capital and emissions to water in the sectors' production functions. The macro-economic costs of a 10, 20 and 50% reduction of the emission levels in the year 2000 of ten priority substances in the EU Water Framework Directive vary between 0.2 and 9.4% of Net National Income (NNI). A large share of the total economic costs are borne by important sources of pollution like commercial shipping, the chemical and metal industry. However, important spin-off effects due to adaptation take place in the tertiary service sector. Besides the estimation of the economy-wide impacts of water quality improvements, the novelty of the study presented here is found in the downscaling of national and sector results to river basin level and the estimation of shadow prices for water-polluting substances through the introduction of an emission permits market. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

To create innovative data combinations and decrease investments, big data is often shared among organizations, crossing organizational boundaries. However, these big data collaborations need to balance disruptive innovation and compliance to a strict data protection regime in the EU. This paper investigates how inter-organizational big data collaborations arrange and govern their activities in the context of this dilemma. We conceptualize big data as inter-organizational systems and build on IS and Organization Theory literature to develop four archetypical governance arrangements: Market, Hierarchy, Bazaar and Network. Subsequently, these arrangements are investigated in four big data collaboration use cases. The contributions of this study to literature are threefold. First, we conceptualize the organization behind big data collaborations as IOS governance. Second, we show that the choice for an inter-organizational governance arrangement highly depends on the institutional pressure from regulation and the type of data that is shared. In this way, we contribute to the limited body of research on the antecedents of IOS governance. Last, we highlight with four use cases how the principles of big data, specifically data maximization, clash with the principles of EU data protection regulation. Practically, our study provides guidelines for IT and innovation managers how to arrange and govern the sharing of data among multiple organizations.","van den Broek, T.A.",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

https://doi.org/10.2196/36322,Health Information Seeking From an Intelligent Web-Based Symptom Checker,"<p>Background: The ever-growing amount of health information available on the web is increasing the demand for tools providing personalized and actionable health information. Such tools include symptom checkers that provide users with a potential diagnosis after responding to a set of probes about their symptoms. Although the potential for their utility is great, little is known about such tools' actual use and effects. Objective: We aimed to understand who uses a web-based artificial intelligence-powered symptom checker and its purposes, how they evaluate the experience of the web-based interview and quality of the information, what they intend to do with the recommendation, and predictors of future use. Methods: Cross-sectional survey of web-based health information seekers following the completion of a symptom checker visit (N=2437). Measures of comprehensibility, confidence, usefulness, health-related anxiety, empowerment, and intention to use in the future were assessed. ANOVAs and the Wilcoxon rank sum test examined mean outcome differences in racial, ethnic, and sex groups. The relationship between perceptions of the symptom checker and intention to follow recommended actions was assessed using multilevel logistic regression. Results: Buoy users were well-educated (1384/1704, 81.22% college or higher), primarily White (1227/1693, 72.47%), and female (2069/2437, 84.89%). Most had insurance (1449/1630, 88.89%), a regular health care provider (1307/1709, 76.48%), and reported good health (1000/1703, 58.72%). Three types of symptoms-pain (855/2437, 35.08%), gynecological issues (293/2437, 12.02%), and masses or lumps (204/2437, 8.37%)-accounted for almost half (1352/2437, 55.48%) of site visits. Buoy's top three primary recommendations split across less-serious triage categories: primary care physician in 2 weeks (754/2141, 35.22%), self-treatment (452/2141, 21.11%), and primary care in 1 to 2 days (373/2141, 17.42%). Common diagnoses were musculoskeletal (303/2437, 12.43%), gynecological (304/2437, 12.47%) and skin conditions (297/2437, 12.19%), and infectious diseases (300/2437, 12.31%). Users generally reported high confidence in Buoy, found it useful and easy to understand, and said that Buoy made them feel less anxious and more empowered to seek medical help. Users for whom Buoy recommended ""Waiting/Watching"" or ""Self-Treatment"" had strongest intentions to comply, whereas those advised to seek primary care had weaker intentions. Compared with White users, Latino and Black users had significantly more confidence in Buoy (P<.05), and the former also found it significantly more useful (P<.05). Latino (odds ratio 1.96, 95% CI 1.22-3.25) and Black (odds ratio 2.37, 95% CI 1.57-3.66) users also had stronger intentions to discuss recommendations with a provider than White users. Conclusions: Results demonstrate the potential utility of a web-based health information tool to empower people to seek care and reduce health-related anxiety. However, despite encouraging results suggesting the tool may fulfill unmet health information needs among women and Black and Latino adults, analyses of the user base illustrate persistent second-level digital divide effects.</p>","Ramondt, S.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

Trial resources could potentially generate benefits for routine health service delivery but may have unintended consequences. Strengthening ethical practice requires understanding the potential effects of trial inputs on the perceptions and practices of routine health care providers. This study explores the influence of malaria vaccine trials on health service delivery in Ghana, Kenya and Burkina Faso.</p><p>METHODS: We conducted: audits of trial inputs in 10 trial facilities and among 144 health workers; individual interviews with frontline providers (n=99) and health managers (n=14); and group discussions with fieldworkers (n=9 discussions). Descriptive summaries were generated from audit data. Qualitative data were analysed using a framework approach.</p><p>RESULTS: Facilities involved in trials benefited from infrastructure and equipment upgrades, support with essential drugs, access to trial vehicles, and placement of additional qualified trial staff. Qualified trial staff in facilities were often seen as role models by their colleagues; assisting with supportive supervision and reducing facility workload. Some facility staff in place before the trial also received formal training and salary top-ups from the trials. However, differential access to support caused dissatisfaction, and some interviewees expressed concerns about what would happen at the end of the trial once financial and supervisory support was removed.</p><p>CONCLUSION: Clinical trials function as short-term complex health service delivery interventions in the facilities in which they are based. They have the potential to both benefit facilities, staff and communities through providing the supportive environment required for improvements in routine care, but they can also generate dissatisfaction, relationship challenges and demoralisation among staff. Minimising trial related harm and maximising benefits requires careful planning and engagement of key actors at the outset of trials, throughout the trial and on its' completion.</p>","Angwenyi, V.",PLoS ONE,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

Much of this work has focused on irrigation systems where upstream users agree to management arrangements that distribute water resources across both upstream and downstream users. A series of design principles have been identified that tend to lead to long-term sustained water management in these types of irrigation systems. However, this prior work has focused on the aggregate outcomes of the water system, and there has been little work evaluating the heterogeneity of water delivery within irrigation systems in developing countries. Heterogeneity of water resources within these systems has implications for livelihood outcomes because it can be indicative of a social, technological, and/or biophysical element facilitating or detracting from water delivery. We present a multilevel analysis of households nested within 25 smallholder irrigation systems in Kenya. Specifically, we examine household-level water outcomes (i.e., average flow rate and reliability of water provisioning) and the community-level and household-level drivers that affect household water outcomes. These drivers include physical infrastructure, institutional infrastructure, and biophysical variables. Much of the common-pool resource literature addresses the rule clusters responsible for natural resource outcomes, but by considering an array of both institutional and physical features and the water delivery outcomes produced at the household level, we offer new explanations for water disparities within smallholder-operated irrigation systems. We further discuss the ability of user-group members to reshape their water delivery outcomes through information exchange.</p>","Dell'Angelo, J.",Ecology and Society,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0195885,How ownership rights over microorganisms affect infectious disease control and innovation,"<p>Background Genetic information of pathogens is an essential input for infectious disease control, public health and for research. Efficiency in preventing and responding to global outbreaks relies on timely access to such information. Still, ownership barriers stand in the way of timely sharing of genetic data from pathogens, frustrating efficient public health responses and ultimately the potential use of such resources in innovations. Under a One Health approach, stakeholders, their interests and ownership issues are manifold and need to be investigated. We interviewed key actors from governmental and non-governmental bodies to identify overlapping and conflicting interests, and the overall challenges for sharing pathogen data, to provide essential inputs to the further development of political and practical strategies for improved data sharing practices. Methods & findings To identify and prioritize barriers, 52 Key Opinion Leaders were interviewed. A root-cause analysis was performed to identify causal relations between barriers. Finally, barriers were mapped to the innovation cycle reflecting how they affect the range of surveillance, innovation, and sharing activities. Four main barrier categories were found: compliance to regulations, negative consequences, self-interest, and insufficient incentives for compliance. When grouped in sectors (research institutes, public health organizations, supra-national organizations and industry) stakeholders appear to have similar interests, more than when grouped in domains (human, veterinary and food). Considering the innovation process, most of barriers could be mapped to the initial stages of the innovation cycle as sampling and sequencing phases. These are stages of primary importance to outbreak control and public health response. A minority of barriers applied to later stages in the innovation cycle, which are of more importance to product development. Conclusion Overall, barriers are complex and entangled, due to the diversity of causal factors and their crosscutting features. Therefore, barriers must be addressed in a comprehensive and integrated manner. Stakeholders have different interests highlighting the diversity in motivations for sharing pathogen data: prioritization of public health, basic research, economic welfare and/or innovative capacity. Broad inter-sectorial discussions should start with the alignment of these interests within sectors. The improved sharing of pathogen data, especially in upstream phases of the innovation process, will generate substantial public health benefits through increased availability of data to inform surveillance systems, as well as to allow the (re-)use of data for the development of medical countermeasures to control infectious diseases.</p>","van de Burgwal, L.H.M.

In order to apply this indicator, a method is needed for classifying visitors to e-infrastructures into relevant user categories. The paper proposes such a method, based on an inductive logic program and a Bayesian classifier. The method is tested, showing that the visitors are efficiently classified with 90% accuracy into the selected categories.

Recent papers suggest both distinctive features of innovation in services and distinctive types of service innovation. This article reviews and evaluates these findings from a Schumpeterian perspective. The evaluation justifies conceptualizing service innovation as a specific case of service development with a reference to Schumpeter, but not as strict as proposed by Drejer (2004) [Drejer, I. (2004) Identifying Innovation in Surveys of Services: A Schumpeterian Perspective. Research Policy, 33, 551–562]. Despite the simultaneity of production and consumption in services, this article claims that the distinction between product innovation and process innovation should be preferred to other ways of classifying innovation in service firms. Finally, changes in the denomination of services are advanced as a key to the identification of development and innovation in service firms.","Jansen, P.G.W.

In the field of bi/multi-objective optimization, to the best of our knowledge, it is still not very common to integrate ILP heuristics into exact solution frameworks. This paper aims to bring a stronger attention of both the exact and metaheuristic communities to still unexplored possibilities for performance improvements of exact and heuristic multi-objective optimization algorithms. We focus on bi-objective optimization problems whose feasible solutions can be described as 0/1 integer linear programs and propose two ILP heuristics, boundary induced neighborhood search (BINS) and directional local branching. Their main idea is to combine the features and explore the neighborhoods of solutions that are relatively close in the objective space. A two-phase ILP-based heuristic framework relying on BINS and directional local branching is introduced. Moreover, a new exact method called adaptive search in objective space (ASOS) is also proposed. ASOS combines features of the ε-constraint method with the binary search in the objective space and uses heuristic solutions produced by BINS for guidance. Our new methods are computationally evaluated on two problems of particular relevance for the design of FTTx-networks. Comparison with other known exact methods (relying on the exploration of the objective space) is conducted on a set of realistic benchmark instances representing telecommunication access networks from Germany.</p>","Leitner, M.",Computers and Operations Research,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

However, the magnitude of the environmental burden that would arise from meeting the needs of the poorest is under debate—especially when compared to much larger burdens from the rich. We show that the ‘Great Acceleration’ of human impacts was characterized by a ‘Great Inequality’ in using and damaging the environment. We then operationalize ‘just access’ to minimum energy, water, food and infrastructure. We show that achieving just access in 2018, with existing inequalities, technologies and behaviours, would have produced 2–26% additional impacts on the Earth’s natural systems of climate, water, land and nutrients—thus further crossing planetary boundaries. These hypothetical impacts, caused by about a third of humanity, equalled those caused by the wealthiest 1–4%. Technological and behavioural changes thus far, while important, did not deliver just access within a stable Earth system. Achieving these goals therefore calls for a radical redistribution of resources.</p>","Verburg, P.H.",Nature Sustainability,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

This paper presents analysis of the use of a pilot referral and decision making support call center for mothers and newborns in the Greater Accra region of Ghana, and challenges encountered in implementing such an intervention. Methods: We analyzed longitudinal time series data from routine records of the call center over the first 33 months of its operation in Excel. Results: During the first seventeen months of operation, the Information Communication Technology (ICT) platform was provided by the private telecommunication network MTN. The focus of the referral system was on maternal and newborn care. In this first phase, a total of 372 calls were handled by the center. 93% of the calls were requests for referral assistance (87% obstetric and 6% neonatal). The most frequent clinical reasons for maternal referral were prolonged labor (25%), hypertensive diseases in pregnancy (17%) and post-partum hemorrhage (7%). Birth asphyxia (58%) was the most common reason for neonatal referral. Inadequate bed space in referral facilities resulted in only 81% of referrals securing beds. The national ambulance service was able to handle only 61% of the requests for assistance with transportation because of its resource challenges. Resources could only be mobilized for the recurrent cost of running the center for 12 h (8.00 pm – 8.00 am) daily. During the second phase of the intervention we switched the use of the ICT platform to a free government platform operated by the National Security. In the next sixteen-month period when the focus was expanded to include all clinical cases, 390 calls were received with 51% being for medical emergency referrals and 30% for obstetrics and gynaecology emergencies. Request for bed space was honoured in 69% of cases. Conclusions: The call center is a potentially useful and viable M-Health intervention to support referral and clinical decision making in the LMIC context of this study. However, health systems challenges such inadequacy of human resources, unavailability of referral beds, poor health infrastructure, lack of recurrent financing and emergency transportation need to be addressed for optimal functioning.</p>","Zweekhorst, M.B.M.",BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

Despite billions of dollars of infrastructure interventions, sustainable water services remain out of reach for millions of people. Professionalized maintenance services have emerged as a service provision strategy to supplement the community-based rural water management approach. This study applies system dynamics modeling to assess the potential impact of scaling up professionalized maintenance services on piped water systems in Kitui County, Kenya. The study results show that over a 10 year simulation, calibrated with 21 months of empirical data and based on a range of key assumptions, delivery of professionalized maintenance services across the county may increase countywide functionality rates from 54% to over 83%, leading to a 67% increase in water production. Furthermore, the increase in preventive maintenance activities and proactive repairs can lead to less frequent major breakdowns and reduction in county government spending on major repairs by over 60%. However, current service fee income from communities accounts for 8% of the total cost of service, necessitating substantial sustained external financing or government subsidies to be financially viable at scale.","Koehler, J.K.L.",Environmental Science and Technology,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

Methods A survey of workers' perspectives on problems, obstacles, retention factors and needs due to ageing was carried out in 3,008 workers aged 45 years and older in nine different companies. To classify the open-ended questions we used the International Classification of Functioning and disability (ICF). Results Older workers with a chronic health condition reported more problems due to ageing (56 vs 34 %; p <.001), more obstacles (42 vs 16 %; p <.001) and more needs (51 vs 31 %; p <.001) compared to those without a chronic health condition. No relevant differences were found on type of experienced problems, obstacles, retention factors and needs between both groups. Problems and obstacles were found on physiological and psychological functions. Retention factors and needs to enhance sustainable working life were particularly reported on work-related environmental factors. Conclusion Because workers with a chronic health condition experienced more problems, obstacles and needs, the largest gain of occupational intervention can be achieved in these workers. However, our findings suggest that interventions aimed to enhance sustainable working life of older workers can be similar in content for persons with and without chronic health conditions and should have a central focus on work-related factors. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","de Boer, M.R.",Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

Efficiency wage setting is incorporated in a spatial two-region general equilibrium model, written as a welfare program. In our model, firms set wages above the market clearing level to create an inducement for employees not to shirk. The economy-wide effect (i.e. social welfare or total welfare) consists of the direct effect in transport market and the indirect effect in other markets. We conduct welfare analyses different from the conventional cost-benefit analysis, in which we distinguish between the direct welfare effect based on consumer surplus in the transport market and the indirect welfare effect through changes in regional unemployment, which is captured in the economy-wide effect. In our model, infrastructure improvement may increase unemployment in one region, but overall unemployment levels fall. The indirect welfare effects through decreases in overall unemployment are about 10-20% of the direct welfare effects for most plausible labor market parameters. The indirect welfare effects are larger, the poorer the initial transport infrastructure and the larger the labor market imperfections. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Rietveld, P.

Work outcomes related to sustainable employment were (i) temporarily being placed in less strenuous work, (ii) sickness absence ≥6 weeks, and (iii) leaving the organization. Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed for all outcome measures. Results Similar predictors were found for shift and day workers although some differences were observed. For shift workers, high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease were important predictors for sickness absence. For day workers, insomnia was an important predictor of sickness absence ≥6 weeks. Conclusions Similar predictors in magnitude and direction were found for work outcomes related to sustainable employment among shift and day workers.

This integration has been characterized by the increase in industrial entrepreneurship in the Arab settlements. Critical to the industrialization process are factors related to the availability of industrial zones and the infrastructure which supports industrial production. The main factors are: limited reserves of land for industry; lack of a land market; the structure and pattern of land ownership; entrepreneurial culture which does not encourage neither using bank loans nor the commercialization of land; the absence of allocation of industrial zones in the settlements master plans; low level of infrastructure and absence of public support for the development of industrial infrastructure; and the fact that the legislation for the encouragement of capital investments has not been applied in Arab settlements. These factors may be divided between external factors partly affected by government discriminative policy which does not support Arab industrial development, and internal factors related to the specific features of the Arab economy. Together, these factors reduce the attractiveness of the Israeli Arab periphery for the arrival of core located major industrial plants, and have a negative impact on Arab internally initiated industrial entrepreneurship.</p>","Drori, I.",Human Organization,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

With the aim of explaining historical change from coal to gas in the British electricity industry, we develop a formal model of technological change, where energy technologies diffuse through the construction of new power plants. We considered two model versions: with rational and boundedly rational investors. In each model version, we look at the causal relations between price and output setting mechanisms, fuel and labour use, and investment decisions for different institutional arrangements. We quantify model parameters on data for the United Kingdom. We find that the version of the model with rational investors is capable of replicating well core features of UK electricity history. This includes a rapid diffusion of gas in electricity production, the evolution of the average size of newly installed plants, and a high percentage of electricity sales covered by (forward) contracts-for-difference. In this model setting, nuclear and renewable energies have no chance to diffuse on the market. In the version of the model with boundedly rational investors, nuclear power typically dominates electricity production. We discuss implications of our modelling results for making a transition to low carbon electricity in the future. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Safarzynska, K.E.

Methods: Ceramic discs (Ø = 10 mm, thickness = 1 mm) were randomly allocated into 6 groups considering: “In-lab simulation of CAD/CAM grinding” (ground or polished) and “intaglio surface treatments”: Ctrl (without surface treatment), AlOx (aluminum oxide air abrasion) or GLZ (glaze spray application). The surface roughness of all samples was measured, the treated discs received a ceramic primer, were luted with resin cement onto a dentin analogue material (woven glass-reinforced epoxy resin) and tested under a cyclic fatigue test (step-stress approach, n = 15; 1.4 Hz, 10,000 cycles/step, step-size of 100N starting at 200N until failure). A complementary analysis was performed to corroborate the findings in the fatigue test that the glaze fill defects increase the mechanical properties of the ceramic. To do so, bars (n= 10; 1.0 × 1.0 × 12 mm; considering the groups: N-ID: non-indented; ID: indented; ID-GLZ: indented plus glaze spray application) were indented in a vickers hardness tester to produce a crack pattern, treated with glaze or not, and then submitted to flexural strength tests (FS). Fractographic and topographic analysis were performed. Results: In-lab simulation of CAD/CAM grinding decreased the fatigue failure load of the 4YSZ ceramic when comparing polished and ground groups, regardless of surface treatment. GLZ induced better fatigue performance compared to the air abrasion, regardless of the grinding condition (ground or polished surface). The results of the flexural strength test corroborated the findings in the fatigue test, as the ID-GLZ group presented superior FS than the ID group, however both had inferior FS than N-ID. There is an inverse association between roughness and fatigue failure load, as the higher the surface roughness, the lower the fatigue failure load. Failures in the fatigue and flexural strength tests started from the face subjected to tensile stresses. Conclusion: In-lab simulation of CAD/CAM grinding had a detrimental effect on the fatigue behavior of 4YSZ and glaze spray induced better 4YSZ performance compared to the air abrasion. The intaglio surface treatments differently influenced the 4YSZ fatigue performance, however, only glaze spray can reverse the damage caused by the grinding.</p>","Werner, A.

However, due to the pervasive uncertainty inherent in the field of microbiota-targeting interventions and associated issues with establishing rigorous safety and efficacy profiles, regulatory oversight is suboptimal. This can dissuade innovators from further exploring novel and much needed health interventions. Modification of regulatory protocols and practices requires focussed efforts and funding to build the evidence base around future regulatory needs. Such modification can be critically informed by identification of changes and trends in technology fields to facilitate identification of regulatory gaps. To this purpose, this study rigorously collected and analysed patent data from Espacenet - covering the years 2013-2018 - and created a patent landscape analysis of microbiome targeting interventions with a focus on medicinal products. Pertinent patenting activity has declined overall. While, in absolute terms, patents most frequently claimed inventions targeting disorders of the gut and alimentary tract, relative year-on-year interest increases have been substantial for cancer, and disorders of the (neuro-)muscular and respiratory systems - driven by the private sector. Academic stakeholders showed top interest in disorders of the metabolism, anti-infectives, and skeletal and dermatological diseases. Although medicinal preparation claims dominated our dataset, a third of patents claimed food preparations, while only 1% claimed application as a diagnostic. Finally, China is, by an inordinate margin, a market of particular interest for both domestic and foreign innovators, indicating that microbiome targeting intervention innovation for EU and US markets might be frustrated. This study is the first to empirically demonstrate that live biotherapeutic product innovation is decelerating and potentially frustrated, supporting the urgent need for improved regulatory standards.

A healthy microbiome is diverse, increasing stability and resilience and strengthening the immune system. In addition, healthy intestinal metabolisms have a beneficial effect on many physiological processes such as the brain function. Looking from the One Health perspective, which recognizes that health of humans is closely connected to the health of animals and environment, it is inherently beneficial to stimulate the health of animals for the well-being of humans. However, the intensive administration of antibiotics to livestock for prevention and cure of disease, and even stimulation of growth, disrupts a healthy microbiome. With the rapid increase of emerging zoonotic diseases, alternatives to the use of antimicrobial compounds are urgently necessary. This research analyses the development of alternatives for antibiotic use contributing to veterinary intestinal health through an in-depth patent analysis of inventions for fodder additives. In the period 1999–2020, 1269 unique patent families describing the use of probiotics, enzymes and prebiotics for swine, poultry and ruminants were identified. Innovation trends, geography, key applicants, and classification of patents were analysed. Asian industrial applicants applied for the majority of patents comprising the largest share of patents for probiotics and enzymes in combination with fodder for swine. Followed by North American and European industrial applications, applying for patents for probiotics in combination with fodder for poultry, swine, and ruminants. Overall, our results do not show a clear increase in innovations, suggesting that innovations in the use of probiotics and enzymes in animal feed appear to be stalling. While in the near future a combination of the use of antibiotics and alternatives is most likely to be implemented, the use of probiotics stands a good chance of replacing antibiotics in animal husbandry and limiting the adverse effects of antibiotic abuse.</p>","Larsen, O.F.A.

https://doi.org/10.1787/9789264072916-6-en,International air transport,"<p>This chapter describes the basic features of international air transport. It opens with a historical perspective from the 1930s to modern day. The modern air transport industry is one that increasingly operates within a liberal market context. While government controls over fares, market entry and capacity continue in many smaller countries, they are gradually and almost universally being removed or relaxed. The chapter explains why the air transport industry is now large - it accounts for about 1% of the GDP of both the EU and the United States. It is an important transporter of high-value, low-bulk cargoes. International aviation moves about 40% of world trade by value, although far less in physical terms. The chapter explores the effects of globalisation on airlines, not just on the demand side - where the scale, nature and geography of demand in global markets has led to significant shifts - but also on the supply side, where government policies (e.g. regarding safety, security and the environment) require international co-ordination. It examines technological developments. Two major innovations in air transport were the introduction of jet engines, which considerably shortened travel times, and the introduction of wide-bodied aircraft, which gave airlines the opportunity to reduce the cost per seat. Both developments reduced the generalised cost of travel, so that they had a positive impact on demand. And in closing, the chapter explores changing industrial needs.</p>","Pels, A.J.H.",,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

However, current theories provide only fragmented insights into the origination of knowledge sharing, and thus offer limited guidance for knowledge management practices in R&D. To integrate and extend these fragmented insights, we undertook two exploratory field studies of knowledge sharing in industrial research organizations. The contributions of this study are the following. First, we introduce three dimensions that differentiate origination mechanisms for knowledge sharing. Second, we show that some of these mechanisms correspond to mechanisms assumed in particular streams of literature, whereas others have been neglected till now. Third, based on our field studies, we show that each of these knowledge-sharing mechanisms have a different value for industrial research practices. Therefore, knowledge management in R&D should facilitate and stimulate a broad portfolio of knowledge-sharing mechanisms.</p>","Berends, J.J.",R&D Management,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

In particular, this study theorizes that brokers establish a network of groups, which increases<br/>perceived knowledge quality vis-a-vis the social capital that employees draw on.<br/>Design/methodology/approach – To test this study’s hypotheses on the influence of the structural position of knowledge brokers on the positive effects of social capital on perceived knowledge quality, this study combines data from an online survey with longitudinal archival data from a youth-care organization who used an enterprise social network (ESN) for knowledge sharing. <br/>Findings – This study found a mitigating effect of being a broker on the relationship between trust and perceived knowledge quality, and also between inter-team interaction and perceived knowledge quality for lower levels of both trust and inter-team interaction on perceived knowledge quality.<br/>Research limitations/implications – Although the hypotheses are supported, in light of prior research, the authors would have expected stronger and positive effects.<br/>Practical implications – This research is particularly interesting because it emphasizes the important role of social capital. For organizations that deal with trust issues, it might help to stimulate employees to broaden their activity on ESNs by becoming active in multiple groups.<br/>Originality/value – While knowledge sharing on ESNs is generally conducive for creating organizational value, there is a lack of understanding of what drives employees’ perception of the quality of shared knowledge, and how this perception may depend on their position in the social network.

To enable such access, resource managers that currently act as gateways to clusters may also do so for clouds, but for this they require new architectures and scheduling frameworks. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of KOALA-C, which is an extension of the KOALA multicluster scheduler to multicloud environments. KOALA-C enables uniform management across multicluster and multicloud environments by provisioning resources from both infrastructures and grouping them into clusters of resources called sites. KOALA-C incorporates a comprehensive list of policies for scheduling jobs across multiple (sets of) sites, including both traditional policies and two new policies inspired by the well-known TAGS task assignment policy in distributed-server systems. Finally, we evaluate KOALA-C through realistic simulations and real-world experiments, and show that the new architecture and in particular its new policies show promise in achieving good job slowdown with high resource utilization.","Iosup, A.",,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

We do so analyzing whether the use of factoring by SMEs differs across countries due to differences in the legal protection of creditors. Our findings indicate that firms operating in countries with legal environments that weakly protect the rights of creditors, with political instability or high enforcement costs, are more likely to use factoring. Managers of riskier and opaque companies operating in such inefficient environments can use the results of this study to better understand that there are suitable options to complement bank financing. Managers who seek loans can use the results to diversify their financing structure through the use of factoring. Since factoring can be used as a complement to bank loans or as a substitute for bank financing, it is important that policy makers take our results into account when revising policies concerning access to external financing.</p>","Kant, J.",Journal of Small Business Management,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

However, despite the fact that previous studies highlight all kinds of benefits of environment-oriented leaders' voluntary workplace green behavior (VWGB) in and for firms, little is known about how these leaders' VWGB could affect a firm team's green product innovation as well as their process innovation. To narrow this research gap, this study theorizes and tests the effect of leaders' VWGB on their team's green innovation, as well as the mediation effect of team green efficacy belief on this relationship. Using a time-lagged research design, we collected data from 497 employees and 80 leaders in Chinese manufacturing firms. The results show that leaders' VWGB directly affects both their team's green product and process innovation, and facilitates the development of team green efficacy, which in turn stimulates team green innovation. This present study extends the multilevel phenomena by reinforcing the importance of leaders' VWGB and team green efficacy on team-level green innovation, and provides practical implications on developing leadership for environmentally sustainable innovation.</p>","Cai, W.

Our analysis on the adoption process of a new core technology by a large telecommunication firm reveals the role of management innovation in fulfilling seemingly paradoxical structural requirements of knowledge accumulation in a dynamic knowledge environment.

It takes the history of the R&D Department of the Royal Philips Electronics of The Netherlands as an example to unravel the dynamics behind industrial R&D management. Designomethodologyoapproach This paper is based upon historical and theoretical studies on industrial R&D institutions and research cultures. Findings The paper proposes that the directors of the Philips R&D Department continually shaped and reshaped the organization in order to retain researchers with creative ideas, and to stimulate innovativeness. The R&D-management was the outcome of a search process that comprehended a mixture of scientific and industrial (management) skills, knowledge and expertise, which together shaped an industrial research culture. One of the most difficult questions for the research managers was to find a balance between the professional status and motives of individual researchers on the one hand and the Philips company production strategy on the other. Over the years, the research leaders stimulated individual creativity in their own way, taking specific business and economic circumstances into account. They operated during different historical periods that reflect their management ideas. Originalityovalue Nowadays, the Philips research takes place at the High Tech Campus. Its philosophy is based upon Chesbrough's open innovation paradigm.

If knowledge sharing is crucial to an organization's interests, but is inherently emergent in nature, how can the organization still manage the process? In order to answer this question, a distinction was made between two approaches towards managing knowledge sharing: an emergent approach, focusing on the social dynamics between organizational members and the nature of their daily tasks, and an engineering approach, focusing on management interventions to facilitate knowledge transfer. While the first is central to today's thinking about knowledge, we used a field study in six organizations to show that both approaches have value in explaining knowledge sharing. Instruments that are part of the engineering approach create conditions for variables in the emergent approach, which in turn also exert a direct influence on knowledge sharing. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Each layer was sectioned, classified into three groups according to yttria content (4-YSZ, 4/5-YSZ and 5-YSZ), and shaped on samples for flexural strength and fracture toughness tests (bars: 1.0 × 1.0 × 11 mm); and Vickers hardness test (plates: 1.5 × 4.0 × 5.0 mm). Flexural strength under monotonic load application (sσ; n = 10) was obtained through two different devices (three-point-bending and ball-in-hole device) and fatigue flexural strength (fσ; n = 15; initial load: 10 N; step-size: 5 N; 10,000 cycles/step) was assessed using a ball-in-hole device under cyclic load application. Vickers hardness test (n = 5), fracture toughness test (n = 10), and additional analyzes (Finite Element Analysis - FEA, Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy - EDS and Scanning Electron Microscopy - SEM) were also performed. No differences were found between the different devices in the monotonic flexural strength test, and FEA showed similar tensile stress distribution for the two devices. 4-YSZ showed higher values of flexural strength under monotonic and cyclic load application modes (sσ = 1114.73 MPa; fσ = 798.84 MPa), and fracture toughness (K<sub>IC</sub> = 3.90 MPa√m). 4/5-YSZ had an intermediate sσ; however, fσ was similar to 5-YSZ (404.00–429.36 MPa) and K<sub>IC</sub> similar to 4-YSZ (K<sub>IC</sub> = 3.66 MPa√m). No statistical differences were found for hardness and Weibull modulus for fatigue flexural strength data. The amount of yttria in the layer compositions increased from 4-YSZ to 5-YSZ, and larger zirconia crystals were observed in the topographic images of 5-YSZ. Failures in the flexural strength and toughness tests started from the face subjected to tensile stress. Different layers of the multi-layered zirconia blank presented distinct mechanical properties. 4-YSZ (cervical layer) presented the highest flexural strength under monotonic and cyclic loads (fatigue), and higher fracture toughness even similar to the transition layer (4/5-YSZ). Hardness was similar between the layers. The ball-in-hole device performed similarly to the three-point bending device and can be used as an alternative to the traditional method.</p>","Werner, A.

A sample of 93 published studies, yielding 123 meta-observations, is used to examine the robustness of the evidence regarding the effect of fiscal policy on growth. Five fiscal policy areas are considered: general government consumption, tax rates, education expenditure, defence, and public infrastructure. Several meta-analytical techniques are applied, including descriptive statistics, contingency table analysis and rough set analysis. On balance, the evidence for a positive effect of conventional fiscal policy on growth is rather weak, but the commonly identified importance of education and infrastructure is confirmed. The results are sensitive to several research design parameters, such as the type of data, model specification and econometric technique.

Because of the release of particles from NP-containing products, it is likely that NPs will enter the soil compartment, especially through land application of sewage sludge derived from wastewater treatment. This review presents an overview of the literature dealing with the fate and effects of metal-based NPs in soil. In the environment, the characteristics of NPs (e.g., size, shape, surface charge) and soil (e.g., pH, ionic strength, organic matter, and clay content) will affect physical and chemical processes, resulting in NP dissolution, agglomeration, and aggregation. The behavior of NPs in soil will control their mobility and their bioavailability to soil organisms. Consequently, exposure characterization in ecotoxicological studies should obtain as much information as possible about dissolution, agglomeration, and aggregation processes. Comparing existing studies is a challenging task, because no standards exist for toxicity tests with NPs.

https://doi.org/10.1111/jpim.12589,"Mitigating the Dark Side of Agile Teams: Peer Pressure, Leaders’ Control, and the Innovative Output of Self-managing Teams","Increasingly, organizations have been employing self-managing teams to circumvent bureaucratic controls and stimulate innovation. However, this goal is not easily achieved; in many situations, informal controls replace formal controls. This study develops a multi-level perspective of control. We explicitly analyze control mechanisms at different levels of the organization and how they affect innovative team output. We theorize and empirically investigate a potential downside of horizontal social control mechanisms at the team level (i.e., peer pressure) affecting self-managing teams’ innovative outcomes. We also discuss managerial control mechanisms at the organizational level (i.e., interactive and diagnostic management control systems) that may help to mitigate such negative effects. We theorize how they may influence the innovative output of self-managing teams, both directly and interactively. We chose a multi-level, multi-source setting for our study and ran three parallel surveys with employees in a Fortune 500 firm. 248 team members, 126 internal team leaders, and 97 organizational leaders enabled us to create a unique database of 97 self-managing software development teams. Our findings confirm that peer pressure is common among established agile teams and that it negatively influences the innovative output of the agile teams.

We show how a state of the art, formal, model-based design framework has been successfully used for model-based design of supervisory controllers for an actual industrial baggage handling system, and for a real-time emulation model of an actual international airport. The high level modeling elements of the applied CIF model-based design framework allow the modeler to concentrate on implementing the baggage handling system design requirements, instead of programming PLC code. It also allows a modular and hierarchical design of the supervisory controller, and provides flexibility in adapting and extending the model. Validation of the controller and the uncontrolled plant by means of simulation and visualization made it possible to catch all modeling errors, leading to very short modeling, testing and error correction iteration loops. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful employment of formal, model-based design in the context of supervisory control for actual, industrial size baggage handling systems, that covers the entire development process from requirements up to and including validation, real-time PLC code generation and implementation. We give an overview of the model-based design framework, discuss several modeling issues, and analyze the results of the industrial applications. We do not go into full technical detail, due to nondisclosure agreements, but tell the story, and give lessons learned that we consider useful for practitioners.</p>","Fokkink, W.J.

However, in some of these environments only miniaturized agents can be used. Furthermore, these agents might be kinetically passive, due to limited resources and size. Therefore, designing and using these agents can be difficult. One possible solution to this problem is to change the agents’ morphology, such that optimally shaped agents reach target destinations simply by passively moving through the fluid. Here, we propose an evolutionary scheme for evolving the agent’s morphology to reach a predefined desired point in a fluid environment. This scheme includes a genotype-phenotype mapping based on Lindenmayer-Systems, as well as custom reproduction operators, selection criterion, and fitness function. In order to allow the simulation of irregularly shaped bodies underwater, we develop a simulation framework based on the Robot Operating System and the Unmanned Underwater Vehicle package. We test the proposed method on a set of 10 target points in a pipe inspection scenario. Results show that the evolved agents reach the target points with a distance error smaller than 5% in the worst case, and a standard deviation of 1.1% over 10 repeated experiments.</p>","Cochez, M.",Materials and Manufacturing Processes,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

On the one hand, they benefit from participation of heterogeneous stakeholders in their efforts to strengthen their expertise. On the other hand, these stakeholders represent highly diverging interests, which makes collective strategic action very challenging. To understand how online communities cope with this tension, we conducted a longitudinal, mixed method case study of an online community focused on development transportation. We argue that online communities are uniquely equipped, through their fluidity and open-endedness, to enable knowledge creation<br/>and agenda setting. In so doing, online communities afford an ‘intermediary space’ that simultaneously accommodates both convergence and divergence of interests. Our study strengthens the bridge between information systems research and development studies, by highlighting the potential of ICT uptake toward ‘remaking participation’ in development debate, while including the perspectives of heterogeneous interest groups.","Soekijad, M.

An Inquiry into the Future of Publishing in the Digital Era,"<p>In its Proposal for a Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market, the European Commission included a new neighbouring right for press publishers with regard to the digital use of their publications “to ensure quality journalism and citizens’ access to information.” (European Commission, 14 September 2016, Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on Copyright in the Digital Single Market, Doc. COM(2016) 593 final, Art. 11(1) and Recital 31.) Undoubtedly, a free and pluralist press is one of the cornerstones of democratic societies. The question is, however, whether this goal can be achieved by adopting an additional layer of protection. From an economic perspective, it seems essential that publishers, including press publishers, develop new business models in the digital environment. To ensure the survival of quality journalism, it is of utmost importance to support the transition to new business models that has already started in the publishing sector. Hence, the question arises whether the proposal of a new neighbouring right is a legislative initiative that makes sense against this background. To answer this question, the following inquiry will first provide an economic analysis of new business models in the publishing industry. On this basis, it becomes possible to assess the proposal of a new neighbouring right in the light of the need to develop new business models that are sustainable in the digital environment. The analysis will show that the introduction of a new neighbouring right is unlikely to offer support in this respect. Instead, it may even impede or delay necessary modernization steps.</p>","Senftleben, M.R.F.",IIC - International Review of Intellectual Property and Competition Law,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

With the exception of relatively dynamic cities such as Dar es Salaam and Arusha, overall non-farm incomes shares are not unambiguously higher than in rural areas as a whole. Non-farm income shares rise sharply and monotonically with quintiles defined in terms of per capita food consumption. In that sense the sector appears to offer an important route out of poverty. The evidence suggests that education, and access to infrastructure, are important determinants of non-farm incomes in peri-urban areas. Women appear to be poorly placed vis à vis the non-farm sector, even after controlling for education, age and other characteristics. Kinship and tribal affinities, and time devoted to communal activities, appear to deter entrepreneurial activity and non-farm employment, but trust in officials and public servants and strong heterogeneous village associations, are important in stimulating non-farm activity. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

An important quality attribute is the total concentration of intact adenoviruses, which currently is determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or anion exchange-HPLC. Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) was evaluated as alternative to the current methods with the aim to have one single method that allows reliable and fast quantification of adenovirus particles throughout the full process. Intact adenoviruses samples from downstream processing and upstream processing were analyzed directly by CE with UV-detection at 214 nm. Only the samples with high amounts of DNA required a simple sample pretreatment by benzonase. Adenovirus particles were separated from matrix components such as cell debris, residual cell DNA, and/or proteins on a PVA-coated capillary using a BGE consisting of 125 mM Tris, 338 mM tricine and 0.2% v/v polysorbate-20 at pH 7.7. Full factorial design of experiments was used for method optimization as part of the analytical quality by design (AQbD) method development approach. The method was validated for the quantification of adenoviruses on five representative samples from the manufacturing process in the range of 0.5×10<sup>11</sup>–1.5×10<sup>11</sup> adenovirus particles per ml (~80 to 250 pmol/l). The CE method showed intermediate precision of 7.8% RSD on concentration and an accuracy (spiked recovery) of 95–110%.

Perspectives from mental health care professionals,"<p>Internet-delivered interventions can be effective in treating mental disorders. However, their rate of use in German psychiatric inpatient routine care is low. The current study aimed to investigate the attitude of mental health care professionals working in inpatient care regarding internet-delivered interventions, including presumed benefits, barriers and facilitators. In total, 176 health professionals from ten inpatient psychiatric hospitals throughout Germany were surveyed on site. The professionals’ attitude towards internet-delivered interventions in inpatient care was assessed by an adapted version of the ‘Attitude toward Telemedicine in Psychiatry and Psychotherapy’ (ATTiP) questionnaire. To identify benefits, barriers and facilitators, we developed open-response questions that were based on the ‘Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology’ (UTAUT) and analyzed by a qualitative content analysis. Professionals reported little experience or knowledge about internet-delivered interventions. Their attitude towards internet-delivered interventions in psychiatric inpatient care was rather indifferent. The most frequently mentioned potential benefits were an optimised treatment structure and patient empowerment; the most frequently anticipated barriers were too severe symptoms of patients, the feared neglect of face-to-face contacts and insufficient technical equipment; and the most frequently mentioned facilitators were high usability of the internet-based intervention, a sufficient functional level of the patient and further education of staff. For successful implementation in the inpatient sector, internet-delivered interventions must be adapted to the special needs of severely mentally ill patients and to the hospital management systems and workflow. In addition, technical preconditions (internet access, devices) must be met. Last, further education of mental health care professionals is needed.</p>","Riper, M.M.

The results show that, in 2 h of computing time, the approach is able to provide solutions that are within 0.37% of the optimal one for six different blocking proposals and two alternative construction providers, so it can be used as an effective support tool in the primary planning stage to suggest preferable track possessions within the existing railway services.</p>","Roberti, R.",Journal of Construction Engineering and Management,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

As these initiatives need to adapt to the constantly changing requirements of the process, they can benefit from an open organizing approach that enables the direct participation of stakeholders, not only in the innovation process but also in its orchestration. Building on the constitutive view on open organizing, we argue that the interactions among various stakeholders can be orchestrated by an open organizing process complemented by elements of closure. However, determining when and how to deploy a closure to complement open organizing remains a practical and theoretical puzzle. We address this puzzle through a longitudinal field study of an award-winning open innovation initiative tackling the sustainability challenges of oceans. We show when and how temporary closures can catalyze the participation of diverse stakeholders across phases, while opening up the organizing process to participatory fine-tuning allows the orchestration to evolve with the changing requirements of the process. By emphasizing the temporal dimension of deploying closure in open organizing, we develop a process model explaining how punctuated openness—open organizing interrupted by moments of closure—can be used as an organizing principle.</p>","Diriker, D.

However very little research has been conducted in understanding the feasibility of implementing iCBT in Eastern Europe. Objective: The aim of this study was to qualitatively assess organizational readiness for implementing iCBT for depression within community mental health centers (CMHCs) across Albania and Kosovo. Methods: We used qualitative semistructured focus group discussions that were guided by Bryan Weiner's model of organizational readiness for implementing change. The questions broadly explored shared determination to implement change (change commitment) and shared belief in their collective capability to do so (change efficacy). Data were collected between November and December 2017. A range of health care professionals working in and in association with CMHCs were recruited from 3 CMHCs in Albania and 4 CMHCs in Kosovo, which were participating in a large multinational trial on the implementation of iCBT across 9 countries (Horizon 2020 ImpleMentAll project). Data were analyzed using a directed approach to qualitative content analysis, which used a combination of both inductive and deductive approaches. Results: Six focus group discussions involving 69 mental health care professionals were conducted. Participants from Kosovo (36/69, 52%) and Albania (33/69, 48%) were mostly females (48/69, 70%) and nurses (26/69, 38%), with an average age of 41.3 years. A directed qualitative content analysis revealed several barriers and facilitators potentially affecting the implementation of digital CBT interventions for depression in community mental health settings. While commitment for change was high, change efficacy was limited owing to a range of situational factors. Barriers impacting ""change efficacy""included lack of clinical fit for iCBT, high stigma affecting help-seeking behaviors, lack of human resources, poor technological infrastructure, and high caseload. Facilitators included having a high interest and capability in receiving training for iCBT. For ""change commitment,""participants largely expressed welcoming innovation and that iCBT could increase access to treatments for geographically isolated people and reduce the stigma associated with mental health care. Conclusions: In summary, participants perceived iCBT positively in relation to promoting innovation in mental health care, increasing access to services, and reducing stigma. However, a range of barriers was also highlighted in relation to accessing the target treatment population, a culture of mental health stigma, underdeveloped information and communications technology infrastructure, and limited appropriately trained health care workforce, which reduce organizational readiness for implementing iCBT for depression. Such barriers may be addressed through (1) a public-facing campaign that addresses mental health stigma, (2) service-level adjustments that permit staff with the time, resources, and clinical supervision to deliver iCBT, and (3) establishment of a suitable clinical training curriculum for health care professionals.</p>","Vis, P.D.C.",JMIR Formative Research,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

Multiple regression analysis was conducted to analyse the relationship between the motivation to start an own business on the one hand and firm growth on the other hand. Three indicators for growth, namely, employment, sales and assets, were used to measure growth. Findings – The results suggest that that pull factors are more important to start the businesses than push factors. This contradicts the common opinion and previous research that push factors are more important than pull factors in developing countries. Furthermore, the study found that pull factors are positively related to firm, whereas push factors are negatively related to firm growth. Research limitations/implications – It should be noted that while this paper makes a number of contributions, there are some limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. For instance, the data for this study were collected from only one type of business, i.e. the furniture industry (in Tanzania). Accordingly, we do not know the applicability of these findings to other businesses in other sectors. Therefore, future research should include businesses in other sectors to ascertain if the present findings are specific to the furniture business only or are applicable to other businesses as well. Practical implications – Our findings indicate that there are differences in motivations among owner-managers in starting the business and subsequent firm performance. Therefore, individuals need different forms of support depending on the level of development of their business, as well as their motivation. For example, we have seen that the presence of role models has a significant effect on business growth. Therefore, the government might consider using the media and other mechanisms to feature stories about successful entrepreneurs. Originality/value – The authors extend the findings of previous studies that investigate the owner-manager motives and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) growth in developed economy settings, but neglected emerging economies. The study also contradicts the common opinion and previous research that push factors are more important than pull factors in developing countries.","Masurel, E.

We aimed to understand these pathways to improved nutrition from the Enhancing Nutrition of Upland Farming Families (ENUFF) Project implemented in northern Laos. We applied an embedded case study design by recruiting 101 participants representing implementers, school and private sector representatives, and beneficiaries, of which 34 participated in interviews and 68 participated in 11 FGDs. This was supplemented by a desk review of project documents. We analyzed the data using a directed content analysis across five pathways using a published framework on impact pathways from NSA interventions to nutrition outcomes. The project contributed to nutrition mainly through three core pathways‐food production, nutrition and WASH‐related knowledge, and agricultural income, supported by strengthening local institutions within the project’s scope. While it is evident that the project contributed to empowering women by saving their time and increasing income, further study is needed to investigate the translation of these aspects to nutrition‐related practices. We also suggest the need to sustain the capacity of local institutions and their engagement beyond the project cycle. To enhance the effectiveness of NSA interventions on nutrition, there is a need to design and implement intervention package with multiple pathways and tailored strategies based on nutrition outcomes, the envisaged pathways, geographical context, and factors affecting these.</p>","Sharma, I.K.

This study aimed to systematically prioritize the unmet needs and research opportunities in infants, children, adults and elderly for probiotics according to their relative importance from a key-opinion-leader (KOL) perspective. In addition, it reveals potential probiotic product characteristics that need improvement from both a patient or consumer and a KOL perspective. Moreover, KOL involvement in the probiotic research & development (R&D) process was assessed. Data was collected by conducting semi-structured interviews and subsequent online questionnaires. The three clinical indications requiring the highest research attention for infants were (infectious) diarrhoea, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC); for children, obesity, AAD and diarrhoea and for adults, AAD, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and Alzheimer's disease. From both a KOL as well as a patient or consumer perspective, clinical evidence needs to be improved for probiotic products. Although the majority of the KOLs consult for and perform research with probiotic companies, they are (surprisingly) not able to sufficiently influence industry research agendas. This study incorporates the insights of KOLs and provides direction in the R&D of probiotics to fulfil unmet medical needs in patients.","van den Nieuwboer, M.

https://doi.org/10.1086/673271,Paul Ehrenfest and the dilemmas of modernity,"This essay considers the highly ambivalent attitude of the Austrian-Dutch physicist Paul Ehrenfest toward contemporary developments in both science and society. On the one hand, he was in the vanguard of the quantum and relativity revolutions, supported industrialization and economic planning based on mathematical models, and, in general, cherished technocratic ideals. The essay highlights several influences that shaped his attitude in these respects, from his ties with the Philips Physics Laboratory and his sojourns in the United States to the utopian visions of H. G. Wells. On the other hand, he was extremely worried about the harmful consequences of contemporary changes in science and society, such as specialization, the growing pace of city life, and the increasing dependence on modern technologies, be they material or mathematical. In this regard, he agreed with cultural critics such as Max Nordau, Henri Bergson, Ostwald Spengler, and Ludwig Klages. Rather than attempting to solve this paradox, the essay suggests that this kind of ambiguity characterized a great deal of innovative science in the period. © 2013 by The History of Science Society.

A lack of resources in the industrial society hindered development just as a lack of information hinders development in the information society. Consequently, the exchange of information becomes essential for more and more areas of society: Companies announce their products in online marketplaces and exchange electronic orders with their suppliers; in the medical area patient information is exchanged between general practitioners, hospitals and health insurances; public administration receive tax information from employers and offer online services to their citizens. As a reply to this increasing importance of information exchange, new technologies supporting a fast and accurate information exchange are being developed. Prominent examples of such new technologies are so-called Semantic Web and Peer-to-Peer technologies. These technologies address different aspects of the inherit complexity of information exchange. Semantic Web Technologies address the problem of information complexity by providing advanced support for representing and processing information.

This article describes the effects of a policy instrument (BioPartner programme) to commercialise scientific research during the emerging stage of the biotechnology sector in the Netherlands. From the year 2000, this instrument provided funding for the reimbursement of academic biotechnology patent applications and assistance with the creation of spin-offs. We studied general trends in biotechnology patent applications in the time period between 1990 and 2009 and quantified the appropriation of academic biotechnology patents by the industry. Biotechnology patent classification codes and the PATSTAT database of the European Patent Organisation were used to define and identify all Dutch biotechnology patent applications. Matching the data from these applications with the names of some 65,000 potential Dutch academic inventors and 3,400 Dutch academic patents, we found a net contribution of the policy instrument of approximately 20 per cent of all Dutch biotechnology patent applications. However, the policy instrument did not result in an increase in the overall number of biotechnology patent applications or their use in the sector. Our data suggest that BioPartner contributed to improve the 0business culture using biotechnology patents0 at universities.</p>","Claassen, H.J.H.M.",Science and Public Policy,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

The objective of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness and financial return from the employers' perspective of this program. Methods: A total of 293 workers in 15 departments were randomized to the intervention (n=8 departments) or control group (n=7). Data on work ability and health were collected using questionnaires. Sick leave data were obtained from the companies. Both the cost-effectiveness analyses and return on investment analyses were performed. Results: After 12 months, the absenteeism costs were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group. At 12-month follow-up, no significant differences were found with respect to the primary outcomes (work ability, mental and physical health status) and secondary outcomes (musculoskeletal symptoms), meaning that the intervention was not cost-effective in comparison with the control group. The net-benefit was €641 per worker, and the intervention generated a positive financial return to the employer. Conclusion: The intervention in the present study was cost-saving to the employer due to reduced sickness absenteeism costs in the intervention group compared with the control group. However, the intervention cannot be regarded as cost-effective as no significant effects were found for work ability and health. Am. J. Ind.

Methods Workers from five plants were eligible to participate in the WHS program. The program consisted of four evaluative components and an intervention component. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to evaluate seven process aspects. Data were gathered by interviews with stakeholders, participant questionnaires, and from registries of the company and occupational health service. Results Two recruitment strategies were used: open invitation or automatic participation. Of the 986 eligible workers, 305 participated in the program. Average reach was 53 %. Two out of five program components could not be assessed on dose delivered, dose received and fidelity. If components were assessable, 85-100 % of the components was delivered, 66-100 % of the components was received by participants, and fidelity was 100 %. Participants were satisfied with the WHS program (mean score 7.6). Contextual factors that facilitated implementation were among others societal developments and management support. Factors that formed barriers were program novelty and delayed follow-up. Conclusion The WHS program was well received by participants. Not all participants were offered the same number of program components, and not all components were performed according to protocol.

https://doi.org/10.1111/jpim.12117,Product innovation processes in small firms: Combining entrepreneurial effectuation and managerial causation,"This article reports a multimethod study of product innovation processes in small manufacturing firms. Prior studies found that small firms do not deploy the formalized processes identified as best practice for the management of new product development (NPD) in large firms. To explicate small firms' product innovation, this study uses effectuation theory, which emerged from entrepreneurship research. Effectuation theory discerns two logics of decision-making: causation, assuming that means are selected to attain goals; and effectuation, assuming that goals are created based upon available means. The study used a process research approach, investigating product innovation trajectories in five small firms across 352 total events. Quantitative analyses revealed early effectuation logic, which increasingly turned toward causation logic over time. Further qualitative analyses confirmed the use of both logics, with effectual logic rendering product innovation resource-driven, stepwise, and open-ended, and with causal logic used especially in later stages to set objectives and to plan activities and invest resources to attain objectives. Because the application of effectuation logic differentiates the small firm approaches from mainstream NPD best practices, this study examined how small firms' product innovation processes deployed effectuation logic in further detail. The small firms: (1) made creative use of existing resources; (2) scoped innovations to be realizable with available resources; (3) used external resources whenever and wherever these became available; (4) prioritized existing business over product innovation projects; (5) used loose project planning; (6) worked in steps toward tangible outcomes; (7) iterated the generation, selection, and modification of goals and ideas; and (8) relied on their own customer knowledge and market probing, rather than early market research. Using effectuation theory thus helps us understand how small firm product innovation both resembles and differs from NPD best practices observed in larger firms. Because the combination of effectual and causal principles leverages small firm characteristics and resources, this article concludes that product innovation research should more explicitly differentiate between firms of different sizes, rather than prescribing large firm best practices to small firms. © 2013 Product Development & Management Association.","Berends, J.J.",Journal of Product Innovation Management,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

The results of qualitative content analysis reveal a coupling effect in reporting on mechanisms of interaction. Although the involvement of the professional field is tightly coupled with the undergraduate programmes at universities of applied sciences at the strategic level, there is an under-representation of university-industry interaction on an operational level, which suggests the need to explore the actual interaction taking place between the professional field and the programmes. Simultaneously, our results indicate that accreditation reports are not able to provide a holistic picture of professional field engagement in the curriculum of undergraduate programmes at the operational level, which questions their role in acknowledging the role of industry in shaping and achieving intended learning outcomes. Perhaps policymakers should consider introducing other tools or standards for addressing the outcome of the engagement and the responsiveness of the programmes at universities of applied sciences to the professional field.","Hasanefendic, S.

We show that risks posed a threat to the identity of the project team, resulting in a discourse focused on attributing responsibility for risks to outsiders and that polarized their relations with stakeholders. Consequently, the project team tried to eliminate risk by withholding information from the stakeholders they regarded responsible for inflicting risks on the project. This exacerbated intergroup relations and led to conflict.

This phase-out and subsequent substitution with alternatives has resulted in a market where both fluorinated and non-fluorinated DWRs are available. These DWR alternatives can be divided into four broad groups that reflect their basic chemistry: side-chain fluorinated polymers, silicones, hydrocarbons and other chemistries (includes dendrimer and inorganic nanoparticle chemistries). In this critical review, the alternative DWRs are assessed with regards to their structural properties and connected performance, loss and degradation processes resulting in diffuse environmental emissions, and hazard profiles for selected emitted substances. Our review shows that there are large differences in performance between the alternative DWRs, most importantly the lack of oil repellence of non-fluorinated alternatives. It also shows that for all alternatives, impurities and/or degradation products of the DWR chemistries are diffusively emitted to the environment. Our hazard ranking suggests that hydrocarbon based DWR is the most environmentally benign, followed by silicone and side-chain fluorinated polymer-based DWR chemistries. Industrial commitments to reduce the levels of impurities in silicone based and side-chain fluorinated polymer based DWR formulations will lower the actual risks. There is a lack of information on the hazards associated with DWRs, in particular for the dendrimer and inorganic nanoparticle chemistries, and these data gaps must be filled. Until environmentally safe alternatives, which provide the required performance, are available our recommendation is to choose DWR chemistry on a case-by-case basis, always weighing the benefits connected to increased performance against the risks to the environment and human health.","Leonards, P.E.G.

https://doi.org/10.1108/JKM-04-2020-0303,Pro-socially motivated interaction for knowledge integration in crowd-based open innovation,"<p>Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study how the online temporary crowd shares knowledge in a way that fosters the integration of their diverse knowledge. Having the crowd integrate its knowledge to offer solution-ideas to ill-structured problems posed by organizations is one of the desired outcomes of crowd-based open innovation because, by integrating others’ knowledge, the ideas are more likely to consider the many divergent issues related to solving the ill-structured problem. Unfortunately, the diversity of knowledge content offered by heterogeneous specialists in the online temporary crowd makes integration difficult, and the lean social context of the crowd makes extensive dialogue to resolve integration issues impractical. The authors address this issue by exploring theoretically how the manner in which interaction is organically conducted during open innovation challenges enables the generation of integrative ideas. The authors hypothesize that, as online crowds organically share knowledge based upon successful pro-socially motivated interaction, they become more productive in generating integrative ideas. Design/methodology/approach: Using a multilevel mixed-effects model, this paper analyzed 2,244 posts embedded in 747 threads with 214 integrative ideas taken from 10 open innovation challenges. Findings: Integrative ideas were more likely to occur after pro-socially motivated interactions. Research limitations/implications: Ideas that integrate knowledge about the variety of issues that relate to solving an ill-structured problem are desired outcomes of crowd-based open innovation challenges. Given that members of the crowd in open innovation challenges rarely engage in dialogue, a new theory is needed to explain why integrative ideas emerge at all. The authors’ adaptation of pro-social motivation interaction theory helps to provide such a theoretical explanation. Practitioners of crowd-based open innovation should endeavor to implement systems that encourage the crowd members to maintain a high level of activeness in pro-socially motivated interaction to ensure that their knowledge is integrated as solutions are generated. Originality/value: The present study extends the crowd-based open innovation literature by identifying new forms of social interaction that foster more integrated ideas from the crowd, suggesting the mitigating role of pro-socially motivated interaction in the negative relationship between knowledge diversity and knowledge integration.

We find that studies which employ data from the US are more likely to register a negative impact of public infrastructure on regional growth. We also find that type of infrastructure, research methodology, time span, type of infrastructure measure, and geographical scale affect the outcomes of the primary studies. Studies that take into account interregional, interstate and interprovincial relations have a higher chance of finding negative effects, which gives an idea about the spillover effects of these investments.

Ethiopia's plan to meet the sustainable development goals for maternal and child health includes unprecedented emphasis on improving quality of care. The purpose of this study was to assess the quality of midwifery care during labor, delivery and immediate postpartum period. Methods: A cross-sectional study using multiple data collection methods and a 2-stage cluster sampling technique was conducted from January 25 to February 14, 2015 in government health facilities of the Amhara National Regional State of Ethiopia. Direct observation of performance was used to determine competence of midwives in providing care during labor, delivery, and the first 6 h after childbirth. Inventory of drugs, medical equipment, supplies, and infrastructure was conducted to identify availability of resources in health facilities. Structured interview was done to assess availability of resources and performance improvement opportunities. Data analysis involved calculating percentages, means and chi-square tests. Results: A total of 150 midwives and 56 health facilities were included in the study. The performance assessment showed 16.5% of midwives were incompetent, 72.4% were competent, and 11.1% were outstanding in providing routine intrapartum care. Forty five midwives were observed while managing 54 obstetric and newborn complications and 41 (91%) of them were rated competent. Inventory of resources found that the proportion of facilities with more than 75% of the items in each category was 32.6% for drugs, 73.1% for equipment, 65.4% for supplies, 47.9% for infection prevention materials, and 43.6% for records and forms. Opportunities for performance improvement were inadequate, with 31.3% reporting emergency obstetric and newborn care training, and 44.7% quarterly or more frequent supportive supervision. Health centers fared worse in provider competence, physical resources, and quality improvement practices except for supportive supervision visits and in-service training. Conclusions: Although our findings indicate most midwives are competent in giving routine and emergency intrapartum care, the major gaps in the enabling environment and the significant proportion of midwives with unsatisfactory performance suggest that the conditions for providing quality intrapartum care are not optimal.</p>","van Roosmalen, J.J.M.",BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

Rapid assessment of public and private midwifery education schools was conducted in 2017 to examine compliance with national educational standards. The aim was to assess midwifery education to inform Afghanistan Nurses and Midwives Council and other stakeholders on priorities for improving quality of midwifery education. Methods: A cross-sectional assessment of midwifery schools was conducted from September 12–December 17, 2017. The Midwifery Education Rapid Assessment Tool was used to assess 29 midwifery programs related to infrastructure, management, teachers, preceptors, clinical practice sites, curriculum and students. A purposive sample of six Institute of Health Sciences schools, seven Community Midwifery Education schools and 16 private midwifery schools was used. Participants were midwifery school staff, students and clinical preceptors. Results: Libraries were available in 28/29 (97%) schools, active skills labs in 20/29 (69%), childbirth simulators in 17/29 (59%) and newborn resuscitation models in 28/29 (97%). School managers were midwives in 21/29 (72%) schools. Median numbers of students per teacher and students per preceptor were 8 (range 2–50) and 6 (range 2–20). There were insufficient numbers of teachers practicing midwifery (132/163; 81%), trained in teaching skills (113/163; 69%) and trained in emergency obstetric and newborn care (88/163; 54%). There was an average of 13 students at clinical sites in each shift. Students managed an average of 15 births independently during their training, while 40 births are required. Twenty-four percent (7/29) of schools used the national 2015 curriculum alone or combined with an older one. Ninety-one percent (633/697) of students reported access to clinical sites and skills labs. Students mentioned, however, insufficient clinical practice due to low case-loads in clinical sites, lack of education materials, transport facilities and disrespect from school teachers, preceptors and clinical site providers as challenges. Conclusions: Positive findings included availability of required infrastructure, amenities, approved curricula in 7 of the 29 midwifery schools, appropriate clinical sites and students’ commitment to work as midwives upon graduation. Gaps identified were use of different often outdated curricula, inadequate clinical practice, underqualified teachers and preceptors and failure to graduate all students with sufficient skills such as independently having supported 40 births.</p>","Manalai, P.

This study develops a game theoretic model that derives the charges (set by the infrastructure operators) and fare prices (set by the transport operators) as well as the associated profit and welfare in equilibrium. Key analytical insights concern the joint effect of the product differentiation by the transport operators and profit/welfare orientation of the infrastructure operators. If the transport operator implements more differentiation between air and HSR, or the infrastructure operators are more profit-oriented, the transport mode becomes less sensitive to the access charge from the competing mode, but more sensitive to the access charge from the same mode. Furthermore, using publicly available data for European and Chinese markets, we investigate the effects of introducing HSR on-track competition and congested infrastructures through numerical studies. Key findings are that entry by an incumbent-owned compared to a privately-owned HSR generates more industry benefits but leads to a significant reduction in consumer surplus. A more profit-oriented airport operator leads to increased total welfare if congestion is sufficient high.

Aims: The investigation of trends in railway suicide during 2008 2018, a period in which preventive measures were taken by Dutch railway infrastructure manager ProRail. Methods: Generalized linear regression models for railway suicide were developed for the period 1970 2007 with general suicide rate, railway traffic intensity, and a combination of these variables as regressors. Subsequently, the best-fitting model was used to investigate trends in railway suicide after 2007 by comparing in retrospect observed values with the expected outcomes of the regression model. Results: An adequate regression model for railway suicide was obtained using both general suicide rate and railway traffic intensity as regressors. Based on this model, while national suicide mortality and railway traffic increased, a distinct relative decline in railway suicides was found from 2012 onward. Conclusions: This decline of railway suicides in the Netherlands may indicate that preventive measures taken by ProRail were effective and prevented around 85 railway suicides annually, a reduction of 30%.</p>","Kerkhof, A.J.F.M.",Crisis,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

This interpretation is also cited in connection to its most popular implementation, known as the ""BASF eco-efficiency portfolio analysis"". There is, however, something strange about this. A ratio is easily visualized as a slope, but BASF's method is working with a distance, which can be formulated as a weighted sum, not as a ratio. Upon closer analysis, it further shows that the two variables receive equal weight. These findings are contradicting the ISO 14045 standard and the perception in mainstream literature. We discuss the relevance of this shift of viewpoint. We also discuss some of the extensions, namely, the socio-efficiency analysis and the SEEbalance. We finally investigate the recent changes that were introduced in the eco-efficiency method, including an eco-efficiency index, and conclude that these changes have been reported in an incomplete way, or in documents that are difficult to trace. Effectively, this means that the most popular way to calculate and visualize eco-efficiency is unverifiable, impeding its status as a science-based method for sustainable industry support.

Governance approaches aiming to foster sustainable transformation of food systems face several challenges due to the complex nature of food systems. Scope and approach: In this commentary we argue that addressing these governance challenges requires the development and adoption of novel research and innovation (R&I) approaches that will provide evidence to inform food system transformation and will serve as catalysts for change. We first elaborate on the complexity of food systems (transformation) and stress the need to move beyond traditional linear R&I approaches to be able to respond to persistent problems that affect food systems. Though integrated transdisciplinary approaches are promising, current R&I systems do not sufficiently support such endeavors. As such, we argue, we need strategies that trigger a double transformation – of food systems and of their R&I systems. Key Findings and Conclusions: Seizing the opportunities to transform R&I systems has implications for how research is done – pointing to the need for competence development among researchers, policy makers and society in general – and requires specific governance interventions that stimulate a systemic approach. Such interventions should foster transdisciplinary and transformative research agendas that stimulate portfolios of projects that will reinforce one another, and stimulate innovative experiments to shape conditions for systemic change. In short, a thorough rethinking of the role of R&I as well as how it is funded is a crucial step towards the development of the integrative policies that are necessary to engender systemic change – in the food system and beyond.</p>","Kok, K.P.W.

The objective of this study is to validate the approach as a promising method in solving such type of problems. Computational results are presented for the job-shop Laurence's instances and two set of instances dedicated to the job-shop with transportation constraints form the literature.

Recently, a productivity gap affects the pharmaceutical industry. The productivity gap describes the situation whereby the invested resources within an industry do not match the expected product turn-over. While risk profiles (combining research and development timelines and transition rates) have been published for new chemical entities (NCE), little is documented on vaccine development. The objective is to calculate risk profiles for vaccines targeting human infectious diseases. A database was actively compiled to include all vaccine projects in development from 1998 to 2009 in the pre-clinical development phase, clinical trials phase I, II and III up to Market Registration. The average vaccine, taken from the preclinical phase, requires a development timeline of 10.71 years and has a market entry probability of 6%. Stratification by disease area reveals pandemic influenza vaccine targets as lucrative. Furthermore, vaccines targeting acute infectious diseases and prophylactic vaccines have shown to have a lower risk profile when compared to vaccines targeting chronic infections and therapeutic applications. In conclusion; these statistics apply to vaccines targeting human infectious diseases. Vaccines targeting cancer, allergy and autoimmune diseases require further analysis. Additionally, this paper does not address orphan vaccines targeting unmet medical needs, whether projects are in-licensed or self-originated and firm size and experience. Therefore, it remains to be investigated how these - and other - variables influence the vaccine risk profile. Although we find huge differences between the risk profiles for vaccine and NCE; vaccines outperform NCE when it comes to development timelines.</p>","Claassen, H.J.H.M.

In national elections, the majority of users can be characterized as politically sophisticated citizens who use VAAs for entertainment purposes and confirmation of their party preference, but a significant minority uses VAAs to learn about politics and make an informed vote choice. VAAs might, however, play a different role in second-order elections, since in these elections campaign dynamics and information supply are very different. In the current research, we applied latent class analysis on user data from a widely used Dutch VAA (Kieskompas) for a supranational and several subnational elections in the Netherlands, to test if an extant typology of VAA users for national elections could be replicated. We find that the typology can be replicated for most of these elections, but also that the relative size of the groups of users differs across elections; in all second-order elections except for the provincial elections, more doubters and seekers are found relative to national elections. This suggests that VAAs are likely to have stronger mobilizing potential in these second-order elections.</p>","Krouwel, A.P.M.",Acta Politica,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

The scientific literature focuses mostly on enabling university-industry technology transfer via university-industry collaboration in research, and not so much in (science) education. The paper identifies four strands of relevant literature for further theorizing SBEE principles to research its contribution to industry-technology transfer: 1. Embedding entrepreneurship education in universities; 2. Balancing theory and practice of entrepreneurship education; 3. Cultivating an entrepreneurial mindset through entrepreneurship education; and 4. Creating spin-offs through entrepreneurship education. One of the main theoretical contributions of this paper is, that SBEE is different from regular entrepreneurship education in its need for being firmly embedded in a science, technology and R&D environment, both within and outside the university. This is important in order to give SBEE students the opportunity to gain experience with handling the hurdles for successful university-industry technology transfer. The main empirical finding is that elements in the program, related to for example the balance between teaching entrepreneurship through theory and experiential learning, are not systematically covered. It means that fundamental questions such as: Can entrepreneurship be indeed taught? Which elements of entrepreneurship can be taught through theory, and which ones must be experienced in practice? are currently left unanswered. Systematic coverage of these questions enables a better exploitation of the possibilities that SBEE offers for university-industry technology transfer.</p>","van der Sijde, P.

Adjuvants are considered immunostimulating substances that can be added to a vaccine. Although adjuvants have the potential to elicit adverse reactions, they also offer certain benefits. After approximately 90 years of R&D, why have only four adjuvants been approved? Although ample literature is available describing the risks and benefits, it remains unclear as to how these potentially rate-limiting factors compare. Experts - representing knowledge institutes, industry and regulatory/public health authorities - were approached in order to collect a unique weighted-ranking dataset on rate limiting factors. Based on the principal-agent theory, there is a partial conflict of interests between the internal perceptions on the challenges faced. Additionally, content analysis reveals four underlying social constructs influencing this perception, namely: attitudes towards risk management, innovation strategy, valuation and funding. This study was designed to explore the topic of rate-limiting factors, and not intended to solve the issues. Moreover we offer previously unpublished and practical insights on the topic, and offer a validated starting point for further research. Ultimately, we would advocate more transparency on reasons for project discontinuation; sharing lessons learned from failed attempts could prove valuable for advancing the field of virosciences. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Reducing congestion is therefore one of the pivotal challenges for Dutch policymakers. In this paper we analyze population-employment dynamics in the Netherlands and concurrently decompose total employment into four broad sectors: manufacturing, distribution, business service and personal service activities. We explicitly allow for inter-sectoral relations to capture employment dynamics more accurately. We introduce a model in which endogeneity and spatial autocorrelation are dealt with by a generalized spatial three stage least squares (3SLS) estimator. Our empirical results suggest that population growth primarily causes the consumer service sector to grow. Employment growth in industrial activities and business services are not decisively affected by population growth. Moreover, the inter-sectoral relations appear more important than between employment and population growth itself.

https://doi.org/10.1787/9789264044616-21-en,Sectoral productivity in the United States,"<p>As the step-up in U.S. productivity growth in the mid-1990s became evident, research on productivity surged. Initially, the new work concentrated on estimating the contribution of information technology (IT) to the productivity pickup, with similar results obtained using industry-level or broad macroeconomic time-series data (Jorgenson and Stiroh 2000, Oliner and Sichel 2000, respectively). Later, studies exploited more detailed data and showed that, while multi-factor productivity (MFP) growth in the IT-producing industries was very high, many services industries also had substantial MFP growth in the late 1990s (Triplett and Bosworth 2004; Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh 2005a, 2005b). It is not surprising that disaggregate data were needed to establish that the resurgence in U.S. productivity growth in the late 1990s went beyond the production of IT and was based, at least in part, in increases in MFP growth in some services industries.291 Detailed analysis had previously documented that many services industries had flat or declining trends in labor productivity for twenty or more years before the pickup in the late 1990s became evident (Corrado and Slifman 1999). The discovery that the ""use of IT"" story was mostly a services phenomenon (Stiroh 1998, Triplett 1999) also required disaggregate data to determine which industries were investing in the newer technologies. In some sense, the well documented variability in the diffusion of new technology and innovation across ranges of products (Mansfield 1968, Gort and Klepper 1982) has long suggested that the available industry data should be studied to detect and identify changes in productivity. This paper presents key trends and developments in productivity growth at an intermediate level of aggregation in the United States, and shows links between the acceleration of MFP and IT. Six custom-made sectors were aggregated up from detailed disaggregated data using a framework that has some nice theoretical properties. Further, the six sectors were defined to provide a more meaningful view of productivity growth than can be found using standard industry hierarchies. The six sectors have highly divergent trends in MFP growth, a result that we believe, in itself, strongly suggests disaggregate data are extremely useful for determining the current trend in aggregate MFP. Similar to previous studies of sectoral productivity, we find that the U.S. productivity resurgence in the late 1990s was a sectoral story, with notable increases in the rate of change in MFP for some sectors partly offset by small step-downs in others. In terms of the sources of growth since 2000, our results show that productivity (MFP) has been the major contributor. We estimate that the rate of change in aggregate MFP picked up notably since 2000, and we now show that this was driven primarily by striking results for finance and business services. Although the major players in the productivity pickup in late 1990s - The tech sector and retail and wholesale trade - were not players in the acceleration since then, we estimate that the rate of MFP growth in these sectors continued to be robust. All told, using our newly developed NAICS-based dataset, we find that by 2004 the resurgence in productivity growth that started in the mid-1990s was relatively broad-based by major producing sector. The plan of this paper is as follows: The next section of this paper spells out our theoretical framework and reviews the basic elements in our system: measures for industrylevel growth accounting, measures of sectoral output and purchased inputs for aggregates of industries, and a structure for aggregating industries to sectors and to the total economy. We then present our results on developments and trends in sectoral productivity and on the role of IT.</p>","Bartelsman, E.J.",,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

However, the current knowledge is far from complete to paint a clear picture of how to evoke employee IWB in the Chinese high-tech industry. Many Chinese high-tech firms face a challenge moving from hierarchy-based leadership toward more employee-centered leadership styles, as the styles have different effects on employees' IWB. This perspective may complement and sharpen the incomplete picture. Drawing on a dynamic componential model of creativity and innovation, this study proposes and tests a moderated mediation model that examines the hypothesized positive influence of servant leadership on employee IWB via meaningful work as well as the moderating role of job autonomy in this process. We collected data (N = 288) from three Chinese high-tech firms and found that employees' perceptions of meaningful work mediate the relationship between servant leaders and IWB. We also found that this mediating relationship is conditional on the moderating role of job autonomy in the path from servant leadership to meaningful work. The results further show that the indirect effect of servant leadership on employee IWB via meaningful work exists only when job autonomy is high.</p>","Cai, W.

It is shown that some aspects such as plate edge nesting, skeleton and remnant cutting, and clamp positioning can be modeled and solved with little additional effort using existing tool path algorithms. However, concepts such as collision avoidance, pre-cut optimization, and bridge utilization prove to be more challenging and will require more profound algorithmic adjustments if these have to be taken into account fully. An even harder problem aspect is generating tool paths that are thermally feasible. Since laser cutting introduces net heat into the metal sheet, the metal sheet tends to heat up as the cutting progresses. Quality deterioration can occur if the laser spends too much time cutting in the same region. It is shown how to model the easy problem extensions in order to handle them using existing problem approaches and solution approaches are suggested to tackle the harder concepts. In addition, a proof of concept is presented that shows that thermal feasible tool paths can be generated through a multi-start heuristic utilizing a thermal penalty function. A finite difference method iteratively (or concurrently dependent on the used heuristic) evaluates the thermal feasibility and updates the penalty function.</p>","Dewil, R.R.H.",,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

The conclusion of this paper, developed through deductive reasoning and supported by preliminary simulation experiments and statistical tests, is that factories with an uncertain and demanding market environment as well as a complex production process could benefit the most from implementing a CPS at shop-floor level since a cyber-physical shop-floor will provide all the capabilities needed to carry out the complex scheduling task associated with this type of context. On the other hand, an increase in scheduling performance due to a CPS implementation in factories with simple production flows and stable demand could not be substantial enough to overcome the high cost of installing a fully operational CPS.</p>","Romero Silva, R.",International Journal of Production Economics,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

Logistic regression analyses were used, adjusted for gender, lifestyle, health, nap behaviour, season of assessment and shift schedule. Shift workers with latest versus earliest chronotype reported a shorter sleep duration (OR 11.68, 95% CI 3.31–41.17) and more awakenings complaints (OR 4.84, 95% CI 4.45–11.92) during morning shift periods. No associations were found between chronotype, sleep and need for recovery during evening and night shift periods. For age, no associations were found with any of the shift-specific outcome measures. The results stress the importance of including the concept of chronotype in shift work research and scheduling beyond the concept of age. Longitudinal research using shift-specific assessments of sleep and need for recovery are needed to confirm these results.

Prior research has shown that time pressure can yield both benefits and challenges to the realization of projects. Unraveling the challenges, we identify three interrelating factors that constrain coordination: the political context of public projects, time pressure within temporary projects, and the nature of transactive memory within permanent organizations. Our study offers a more comprehensive conceptualization of project coordination by including temporary project teams, permanent organizations, and the political context in the analysis. In doing so, we strengthen understanding of pacing by revealing how political pressure and political priorities increase the work pace of temporary projects, thereby constraining the coordination between fast-paced projects and slower-paced, permanent organizations. Finally, our study contributes to literature on strategic knowledge coordination by explaining how the differentiated nature of transactive memory across organizational settings inhibits timely coordination.","Groenewegen, P.

In this new competitive landscape we observe new organizational forms and new business models, including the emergence of platforms and multi-sided markets. This emergence has required a strategic response from incumbent firms, including both well-established firms and some first-generation digital enterprises. With these advances in digital technology, the very nature of strategy is changing. Fundamentally, the use of digital technologies may provide new opportunities for efficiency gains, customer intimacy, and innovation. However, without the right mindset for change, appropriate digital routines, and structural changes, digital transformation efforts will fail. We therefore present a framework for strategizing in this new digital competitive landscape that underscores the importance of the interplay between (1) the cognitive barriers faced by managers when trying to understand this new digital world and envision new digital business models, (2) a need to reconfigure and extend digital routines, and (3) new organizational forms that are better equipped to creating value and gaining competitive advantage. From this framework of essential pillars, we derive four journeys of digital transformation for companies that were formed in the pre-digital economy. We also describe the management roles required by top, middle, and frontline managers, depending on whether the digital migration is evolutionary or transformative and whether the firm is responding to or attempting to shape the ecosystem. Although digital transformation is technically all about technology, the more important issue is how companies make their way through this strange new digital world in which they find themselves. Ultimately digital transformation is as much about strategizing as it is about technology.</p>","Khanagha, S. (+1 more)",Long Range Planning,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

However, such effects can only be achieved if technologies are used as intended. The aim of this study is to gain a better understanding of determinants influencing the success of the introduction of new technologies as perceived by nursing staff. Methods. The study population is a nationally representative research sample of nursing staff (further referred to as the Nursing Staff Panel), of whom 685 (67%) completed a survey questionnaire about their experiences with recently introduced technologies. Participants were working in Dutch hospitals, psychiatric organizations, care organizations for mentally disabled people, home care organizations, nursing homes or homes for the elderly. Results: Half of the respondents were confronted with the introduction of a new technology in the last three years. Only half of these rated the introduction of the technology as positive. The factors most frequently mentioned as impeding actual use were related to the (kind of) technology itself, such as malfunctioning, ease of use, relevance for patients, and risks to patients. Furthermore nursing staff stress the importance of an adequate innovation strategy. Conclusions: A prerequisite for the successful introduction of new technologies is to analyse determinants that may impede or enhance the introduction among potential users. For technological innovations special attention has to be paid to the (perceived) characteristics of the technology itself. © 2011de Veer et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Fleuren, M.A.H.

Supervisory control synthesis enables the design engineer to automatically generate a supervisory controller from a model of the plant and a model of the controller requirements. Although supervisory control theory is an active research area, the number of industrial applications remains relatively low. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of guidelines for practical applications of supervisory control theory, especially in case of large-scale systems with numerous components and complex dependencies. In this paper, guidelines are given for the process of obtaining and validating a supervisory controller, more specifically for large-scale systems with isomorphisms. Systems with isomorphisms are systems with a high degree of symmetry and repetitiveness in their components, such as manufacturing lines with parallel processing lines or infrastructural systems with repeating modules. This paper shows how coordination between the steps in obtaining a supervisory controller for a large-scale system improves the efficiency of the process and quality of the end result, and how the isomorphism of components in the system can be exploited in these steps. This process is demonstrated in this paper by a case study related to the Eerste Heinenoordtunnel, a road tunnel in the Netherlands. The case study shows the steps of modeling the plant and the controller requirements, performing model reduction based on isomorphisms in the system, synthesizing the supervisory controller, and validating the controller by means of simulation.","Fokkink, W.J.",Control Engineering Practice,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

The authors review and structure the literature regarding integration strategies and implementation methods to develop a strategic decision-making framework for SCM in the FEI. Design/methodology/approach - The authors conduct a review of SCM literature, including supply chain strategy, supply chain integration (SCI), agile and responsive supply chain and SCM for innovative and fastchanging industries. The authors develop a conceptual model and a decision-making framework and use four mini cases to provide support for the model and framework. Findings - The FEI, characterised by a high level of innovation and differentiation, short products/services lifecycle and high variety, is yet to be fully defined. Inherent uncertainty in FEI supply systems makes SCM in these industries a complex but strategic task for their managers. The framework and the model offered in this study, which employ a core competency concept and provide risk management strategies, offer a strategic tool for managers and scholars in the field to optimise their integration strategies and to operationalise integration decisions. Originality/value - Little research has been published on transferable and cross-industrial SCM in FEIs.

Software systems will play an important role in moving towards these targets. Sustainability skills are necessary to support the development of software systems and to provide sustainable IT-supported services for citizens. <br/><b>Gap:</b> While there is a growing number of academic bodies, including sustainability education in engineering and computer science curricula, there is not yet comprehensive research on the competencies and skills required by IT professionals to develop such systems. <br/><b>Research goal:</b> This study aims to identify the IT industry needs for sustainability-related competencies and skills. To inform the design of future IT educational programmes we answer the following questions: (1) what are the interests of organisations with an IT division with respect to sustainability? (2) what do organisations want to achieve with respect to sustainability, and how? and (3) what are the sustainability-related competencies and skills that organisations need to achieve their sustainability goals? <br/><b>Methodology:</b> We conducted a qualitative study with interviews and focus groups with experts from twenty-eight organisations with an IT division from nine countries to understand their interests, goals and achievements related to sustainability, and the skills and competencies needed to achieve their goals. <br/><b>Results:</b> Our findings show that organisations are interested in sustainability, both idealistically and increasingly for core business reasons. They seek to improve the sustainability of processes and products but encounter difficulties, like the trade-off between short-term financial profitability and long-term sustainability goals or an unclear understanding of sustainability concepts. To fill these gaps, they have promoted in-house training courses, collaborated with universities, and sent employees to external training. The acquired competencies should support translating environmental and social benefits into economic ones and make sustainability an integral part of software development. We conclude that educational programs should include knowledge and skills on core sustainability concepts, system thinking, soft skills, technical sustainability, building the business case for sustainability, sustainability impact and measurements, values and ethics, standards and legal aspects, and advocacy and lobbying.","Lago, P.",,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+2 more)"

To meet these needs, employers may offer their employees health surveillance programs, to increase opportunities to work on health and sustained employability. However, evidence for these health surveillance programs is lacking. The FLESH study (Functional Labour Evaluation for Sustained Health and employment) was developed to evaluate a comprehensive workers' health promotion program on its effectiveness, cost-benefit, and process of the intervention. Methods. The study is designed as a cluster randomised stepped wedge trial with randomisation at company plant level and is carried out in a large meat processing company. Every contracted employee is offered the opportunity to participate in the POSE program (Promotion Of Sustained Employability). The main goals of the POSE program are 1) providing employee's insight into their current employability and health status, 2) offering opportunities to improve employability and decrease health risks and 3) improving employability and health sustainably in order to keep them healthy at work. The program consists of a broad assessment followed by a counselling session and, if needed, a tailored intervention. Measurements will be performed at baseline and will be followed up at 20, 40, 60, 80, 106 and 132 weeks. The primary outcome measures are work ability, productivity and absenteeism. Secondary outcomes include health status, vitality, and psychosocial workload. A cost-benefit study will be conducted from the employers' perspective. A process evaluation will be conducted and the satisfaction of employer and employees with the program will be assessed. Discussion. This study provides information on the effectiveness of the POSE program on sustained employment. When the program proves to be effective, employees benefit by improved work ability, and health. Employers benefit from healthier employees, reduced sick leave (costs) and higher productivity. The study can expose key elements for a successful implementation and execution of the POSE program and may serve as an example to other companies inside and outside the industry. © 2012 van Holland et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","de Boer, M.R.",BMC Public Health,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

Our vision is a development process where a (software) system specification is based on multiple domain models, and where the specification method is built from cognitive concepts, presumably derived from natural language. Goal: To realize this vision, we evaluate and reflect upon the existing literature in domain-oriented specification techniques. Method: We designed and conducted a systematic literature review on domain-oriented specification techniques. Results: We identified 53 primary studies, populated the classification framework for each study, and summarized our findings per classification aspect. We found many approaches for creating domain models or domain-specific languages. Observations include: (i) most methods are defined incompletely; (ii) none offers methodical support for the use of domain models or domain-specific languages to create other specifications; (iii) there are specification techniques to integrate models in general, but no study offers methodical support for multiple domain models. Conclusion: The results indicate which topics need further research and which can instead be reused to realize our vision on system development.

https://doi.org/10.1111/1911-3846.12627,Tax loss carryovers in a competitive environment,"The fact that incumbent firms can immediately deduct research and development (R&D) investments from taxable income is generally believed to give them a strategic advantage over new firms that cannot deduct the investment cost, but instead generate a net operating tax loss carryover. Using an analytical model, we show that this conventional wisdom need not hold in a competitive environment. We examine operating and investment decisions in a duopolistic industry in which an initial investment in R&D yields an immediate tax benefit for one firm, but creates a net operating loss carryover for the other firm. If both firms invest in R&D, the firm with the net operating loss carryover makes more aggressive capital investment decisions following successful R&D. This may deter the incumbent firm from investing in R&D despite the lower after‐tax costs of this investment. Changing the tax loss carryover rules would thus not only affects start‐up or loss firms, but would also affect the investment decisions of profitable firms in the same industry.","Wielhouwer, J.L.",Contemporary Accounting Research,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

Design: Qualitative, multisite, comparative case study design. Setting: One primary care and 11 acute care organisations (trusts) across all health regions in England in the context of infection prevention and control. Participants and data analysis: 121 semistructured individual and group interviews with 109 informants, involving clinical and non-clinical staff from all organisational levels and various professional groups. Documentary evidence and field notes were also used. 38 technology adoption processes were analysed using an integrated approach combining inductive and deductive reasoning. Main findings: Those involved in the process variably accessed three types of innovation knowledge: 'awareness' (information that an innovation exists), 'principles' (information about an innovation's functioning principles) and 'how-to' (information required to use an innovation properly at individual and organisational levels). Centralised (national, government-led) and local sources were used to obtain this knowledge. Localised professional networks were preferred sources for all three types of knowledge. Professional backgrounds influenced an asymmetric attention to different types of innovation knowledge. When less attention was given to 'how-to' compared with 'principles' knowledge at the early stages of the process, this contributed to 12 cases of incomplete implementation or discontinuance after initial adoption. Conclusions: Potential adopters and change agents often overlooked or undervalued 'how-to' knowledge. Balancing 'principles' and 'how-to' knowledge early in the innovation process enhanced successful technology adoption and implementation by considering efficacy as well as strategic, structural and cultural fit with the organisation's context. This learning is critical given the policy emphasis for health organisations to be innovation-ready.</p>","Kyratsis, I.",BMJ Open,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2022.06.020,Tensions in multilateral coopetition,"<p>Coopetition may help firms to respond collectively to technological change, and compete against disruptive innovation. Yet, coopetition often creates tensions, as coopetitors need to engage in persistently contradictory activities. While existing research focuses on dyadic coopetition, we know much less about multilateral coopetition; specifically, how tensions in multilateral coopetition arise and how they are managed in response to disruptive innovation. We use an in-depth case study of nine Dutch firms, who respond to digital disruption by introducing a new digital music platform, to analyse how tensions evolve in a multilateral coopetition entity. Our findings reveal two coopetitive tensions: a novel multilateral generalist–specialist contribution tension, and the well-known value creation–capture tension. The generalist–specialist contribution is an actor-activity-based tension that originates from the variable contributions of different vertical and horizontal coopetitors over time. Coopetitors try to resolve or balance this tension constantly via commensuration and orchestration of individual coopetitors' contributions, but the tension remains dormant and therefore re-appears. The second tension appears to stabilize over time as the coopetitive entity manages to balance the value creation–capture tension through an iteration of cooperation-inducing, competition-inducing and attendance to redirecting external events. The tensions are interlinked: the generalist–specialist contribution tension triggers subgroup coalition formation, which spurs the value creation–capture tension. We contribute to the coopetition literature by explaining how tensions emerge and are managed in multilateral coopetition, pointing to a new tension inherent in multilateral coopetition. Furthermore, we show how disruptive innovation uniquely shapes multilateral coopetition by inducing cooperative behaviour.</p>","Cepa, K.C.",Industrial Marketing Management,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

We argue that existing R&D collaboration with one of the two value chain partners (suppliers or customers) is associated with the formation of new R&D collaboration with the other value chain partner to ensure temporal alignment in innovation within the value chain. In contrast, issues related to governance and unintended knowledge spillovers suggest that ‘horizontal’ R&D collaboration with competitors only spurs R&D collaboration with other partner types if such competitor R&D collaboration has been discontinued earlier (‘delayed temporal alignment’). We posit that persistent prior R&D collaboration with institutional partners is an antecedent to the establishment of new R&D collaboration with industrial partners, and that discontinuation of a particular type of R&D collaboration is likely to lead to a restart of such R&D collaborative effort. Strong prior innovative performance is expected to increase the probability that firms establish R&D collaborations with new partner types, except for R&D collaboration with competitors, since the most innovative firms may fear leakage of proprietary knowledge to rivals. We find broad support for these predictions in a large panel of Spanish innovating firms (2004–2011). Our findings highlight that it is not just the configuration of R&D collaborations with existing partner types that predicts tie formation with new partner types, but also the intertemporal pattern of prior R&D collaboration and managerial discretion provided by past innovation success.</p>","Gilsing, V.A.",Long Range Planning,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

One of the major challenges for such a vision is the need to construct many unique individuals without prior knowledge of what designs evolution will produce. To this end, an autonomous robot fabrication system for evolutionary robotics, the Robot Fabricator, is introduced in this paper. Evolutionary algorithms can create robot designs without direct human interaction; the Robot Fabricator will extend this to create physical copies of these designs (phenotypes) without direct human interaction. The Robot Fabricator will receive genomes and produce populations of physical individuals that can then be evaluated, allowing this to form part of the evolutionary loop, so robotic evolution is not confined to simulation and the reality gap is minimised. In order to allow the production of robot bodies with the widest variety of shapes and functional parts, individuals will be produced through 3D printing, with prefabricated actuators and sensors autonomously attached in the positions determined by evolution.

This paper examines how modern insights about bounded rationality, social interaction and learning can contribute to making transition polices more effective in addressing barriers and opportunities to realize a sustainability transition in the near future. We argue that the behavioral underpinnings of features like lock-in, surprises in innovation systems and network interactions have been insufficiently elaborated and connected to policy design. We identify and illustrate the most important behavioral features of relevant stakeholders in transition processes. By focusing on behavioral features at both individual and organizational levels, we arrive at recommendations for policy makers regarding important barriers to change and how to overcome these. Specific policy insights are offered at multiple levels, for different stakeholders, and associated with both behavioral biases and social interactions. The analysis combines insights from the literatures on sustainability transitions, ""environmental-behavioral economics"", and behavioral foundations of learning and innovation. Our framework may serve as a basis for coherent behavior studies of transitions that otherwise run the risk of being ad hoc.

Both industrial marketing scholars and industrial marketers seek insights to understand how our knowledge and practice of digital marketing has been structured and configured. To address this gap, we adopt the resource-based perspective as an organizing framework and systematically review 129 articles spanning two decades of research to identify different digital marketing capabilities in industrial firms. From this analysis, we identify four themes: channels, social media, digital relationships, and digital technologies. We then stress-test this knowledge with managerial practices by conducting an online survey of 169 managers, designed to establish the repertoire of current and future marketing capability needs of industrial firms. Herein, we identify two marketing capabilities gaps: the practice gap—which identifies the deficit between managers' ‘current’ practices and their ‘ideal’ digital marketing capabilities; and, the knowledge gap—which demonstrates a significant divide between the digital marketing transformations in industrial firms and the extant scholarly knowledge that underpins this. Based on these results, we build an agenda for future research on digital marketing capabilities.</p>","Herhausen, D.B.

https://doi.org/10.1111/1751-7915.12817,The DIY Digital Medical Centre,"<p>Healthcare systems worldwide are confronted with major economic, organizational and logistical challenges. Historic evolution of health care has led to significant healthcare sector fragmentation, resulting in systemic inefficiencies and suboptimal resource exploitation. To attain a sustainable healthcare model, fundamental, system-wide improvements that effectively network, and ensure fulfilment of potential synergies between sectors, and include and facilitate coherent strategic planning and organisation of healthcare infrastructure are needed. Critically, they must be specifically designed to sustainably achieve peak performance within the current policy environment for cost-control, and efficiency and quality improvement for service delivery. We propose creation of a new healthcare cluster, to be embedded in existing healthcare systems. It consists of (i) local 24/7 walk-in virtually autonomous do-it-yourself Digital Medical Centres performing routine diagnosis, monitoring, prevention, treatment and standardized documentation and health outcome assessment/reporting, which are online interfaced with (ii) regional 24/7 eClinician Centres providing on-demand clinical supervision/assistance to Digital Medical Centre patients. Both of these are, in turn, online interfaced with (iii) the National Clinical Informatics Centre, which houses the national patient data centre (cloud) and data analysis units that conduct patient- and population-level, personalized and predictive(-medicine) intervention optimization analyses. The National Clinical Informatics Centre also interfaces with biomedical research and prioritizes and accelerates the translation of new discoveries into clinical practice. The associated Health Policy Innovation and Evaluation Centre rapidly integrates new findings with health policy/regulatory discussions. This new cluster would synergistically link all health system components in a circular format, enable not only access by all arms of the health service to latest patient data, but also automatic algorithm analysis and prediction of clinical development of individual patients, reduce bureaucratic burden on medical professionals by enabling a greater level of focus of their expertise on non-routine medical tasks, lead to automatic translation of aggregate patient data/new knowledge into medical practice, and orient future evolution of health systems towards greater cohesion/integration and hence efficiency. A central plank of the proposed concept is increased emphasis on reduction of disease incidence and severity, to diminish both patient suffering and treatment costs. This will be achieved at the individual and population levels, through (i) significantly improved access to medical services, (ii) stronger focus on primary and secondary prevention and early treatment measures, and disease susceptibility prediction via personalized medicine, involving inter alia genome analysis at birth and periodic analysis of microbiomes and biomarkers, and integration with other patient health and epidemiology parameters, (iii) improved surveillance and (iv) intervention outcome benchmarking. The dMCs will become drivers of innovation and integrative evolution in health systems, of disease reduction and efficiency gains, and thus major contributors to development of sustainability of health care.</p>","Timmis, J.K.",Microbial Biotechnology,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-5885.2006.00232.x,The effect of IT and Co-location on knowledge dissemination,"<p>Due to the increasing globalization of businesses, new ideas for innovation need to be disseminated rapidly both within and across different departments and divisions. Frequently, ideas and information are dispersed over globally distributed organizations or team members. As a result, the exchange of knowledge has become not only very important for innovation but also highly complex. To facilitate this knowledge exchange, electronically mediated interactions are growing rapidly, replacing traditional face-to-face communications. However, literature provides contradicting results regarding the effectiveness of computer-mediated communication (CMC) versus face-to-face communication. This study attempts to reconcile differences in the literature on the benefits of CMC technologies and co-location. Focusing on knowledge dissemination in technology development processes in high-technology firms, the study investigates the relative impact of CMC technologies and co-location of research and development (R&D) staff, as well as the mutual interaction between them. The present article hypothesizes that CMC technologies and colocation of R&D staff have a positive impact on knowledge dissemination. Further, it is hypothesized that it is more favorable to co-locate R&D staff than to invest in CMC technologies and that the effects of co-location and CMC interact negatively. These hypotheses are tested using empirical data collected from 277 high-technology firms in the United States, and the results are generalized by conducting the same test on data from 125 high-technology firms in the Netherlands. Tests are conducted in a real-world setting, differing from previous comparative studies that mainly used laboratory experiments. Empirical results support the main effects of CMC technologies and co-location of R&D staff on knowledge dissemination. Other empirical results contradict conventional wisdom. Investing in CMC technologies is found to be favorable over co-locating R&D staff for knowledge dissemination. Moreover, the two communication channels strengthen each other. The discussion section presents the contours of a firm-level theory on communication infrastructures and knowledge dissemination, focusing on the scope and the heterogeneity of knowledge dissemination, which may explain these initially surprising results. From the arguments it follows that the choice for investment in co-location or CMC technologies depends on the scope of knowledge dissemination that has to be facilitated. Furthermore, the conclusion is made that effective knowledge dissemination requires a balanced investment in co-location and information technologies to be able to deal with the heterogeneous but interdependent types of knowledge dissemination.</p>","Berends, J.J.",Journal of Product Innovation Management,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

This research focuses on the impact of radical innovation congruence - the degree to which management values regarding radical innovation match radical innovation norms in the business unit. We offer a model and empirically test it to assess the impact of radical innovation congruence on new product performance. We find that radical innovation norms are positively associated with new product performance, whereas we find no such association for management values and new product performance. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find a significant effect of radical innovation congruence on new product performance; however, we did find that radical innovation incongruence can have a positive effect on new product performance but only when radical innovation norms are higher than management values. Thus, we suggest that the unintended situation of radical innovation incongruence may result in some positive consequences after all. Further, high radical innovation norms, far more than management values, seem to be critical determinants of new product performance.","Grinstein, A.",Industrial Marketing Management,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

In Huizing et al. (2020), Huizing et al. proposed the Median Routing Problem (MRP) to optimally schedule agents to a given set of non-urgent tasks, such that the response time for urgent tasks remains minimal. They proposed both an exact MILP-solution and a fast, scalable and accurate heuristic. However, when implementing the MRP-solution in a real-life pilot with a Dutch railway provider, we found that the model needed to be extended by including additional practical objectives and constraints. Therefore, in this paper, we extend the MRP to the so-called Enriched Median Routing Problem (E-MRP), making the model much better aligned with considerations from practice. Accordingly, we extend the MRP-based solutions to the E-MRP. This allows us to compare the performance of our proposed E-MRP solutions to performance obtained in the current operational practice of our partnering railway infrastructure company. We conclude that the E-MRP solution leads to a strong reduction in emergency response times compared to current practice by smartly scheduling the same volumes of non-urgent tasks.</p>","van der Mei, R.D.

This is because the bulk of a nation's manufacturing output flows through them. The intermediaries (e.g., distributors, wholesalers, retailers) constituting marketing channels perform specific distribution functions, such as transportation, storage, sales, financing, and relationship building, better than most manufacturers. Over his distinguished career, Louis P. Bucklin investigated many questions about the structuring and functioning of marketing channels using conceptual, empirical, and microeconomics model-based methodologies. Today, the academic marketing literature contains hundreds of articles that have employed these three broad classes of methodologies to investigate issues of channel intermediaries' interorganizational relationships, for example, power-dependence, relational outcomes, conflict and negotiations, and manufacturing firms' channel strategy, for example, channel structure, selection, coordination and control. So far, however, there has been no review of how the three different methodologies have contributed to advancing knowledge across this set of channels research domains. This paper is the first that aims to (1) chart how channels research employing each of the three classes of methodologies - conceptual, empirical, microeconomics model-based - has evolved over seven decades along with current trends; (2) review the contributions and shortcomings of research to date using these methodologies; and (3) suggest future research opportunities using these methodologies, separately or in an integrated fashion.","Sotgiu, F.",Journal of Retailing,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"
https://doi.org/10.1111/jpim.12020,The formation of fairness perceptions in the cooperation between entrepreneurs and universities,"For entrepreneurs who intend to exploit university-owned technologies, a cooperative relationship with the university is critical. This study aims to better understand this entrepreneur-university cooperation. A key factor influencing the quality of this cooperation is the fairness perception of the entrepreneur. However, little is known about how these fairness perceptions are formed in this context. Therefore, to increase insight in entrepreneur- university cooperation, this study explores the formation of fairness perceptions by entrepreneurs who cooperate with universities (in so-called university spin-offs). This study assesses how the rules these entrepreneurs employ to form fairness perceptions differ from fairness rules that have been established in previous studies on organizational justice. The results show that, in addition to established fairness rules, there are also fairness rules that are more specific to this entrepreneurial setting. These specific rules complement the established fairness rules to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the formation of fairness perceptions by entrepreneurs cooperating with a university. Moreover, this study explores to what extent different entrepreneurs form fairness perceptions differently and finds that both experience and relational capital of the entrepreneurs within the university are two key sources of heterogeneity. Overall, this study contributes to the literature by conceptualizing how entrepreneurs form fairness perceptions in cooperating with universities and how this extends established wisdom in organizational justice theory. Moreover, the rules identified in this study provide clues for entrepreneurs who wish to improve their collaboration with universities, and may also apply to the relationships between entrepreneurs and large corporations and between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. © 2013 Product Development & Management Association.","Gilsing, V.A.

This article is the first to study the behavior of unpaced, reliable, and unreliable merging assembly lines that are deliberately unbalanced with respect to their coefficients of variation (CV). Conducting a series of simulation runs with varying line lengths, buffer storage capacities and unbalanced CV patterns delivers intriguing results. For both reliable and unreliable lines, the best pattern for generating higher throughput is found to be a balanced configuration (equal CVs along both parallel lines), except for unreliable lines with a station buffer capacity of six. In that case, the highest throughput results from the descending configuration, i.e. concentrating the variable stations close to the beginning of both parallel lines and the steady stations towards the end of the line. Ordering from the least to most steady station also provides the best average buffer level. By exploring the experimental Pareto Frontier, this study shows the combined performance of unbalanced CV patterns for throughput and average buffer level. Study results suggest that caution should be exercised when assuming equivalent behavior from reliable and unreliable lines, or single serial lines and merging lines, since the relative throughput performance of some CV patterns changed between the different configurations.</p>","Romero Silva, R.",International Journal of Production Economics,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

Specimens of five ceramics (FC- feldspathic glass-ceramic; PICN- polymer-infiltrated ceramic-network; ZLS- zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass-ceramic; LD- lithium disilicate glass-ceramic; YZ- yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal ceramic) to be tested under impact (15×10×2mm3; n= 15) were divided into two groups, according to surface treatment: polishing (pol) and grinding (gri) as CAD/CAM milling simulation. Impact strength was tested using the Dynstat method. Roughness, topographic, fractographic and finite element analyses were performed. The impact strength data were analyzed by Weibull, and Pearson correlation was used to correlate roughness and impact strength data. The CAD/CAM milling simulation led to significantly (p<0.05) greater roughness (Ra and Rz) and statistically reduced the impact strength for PICN (polPICN= 4.59 to griPICN= 1.09; ±76% decrease), for LD (polLD= 17.69 to griLD= 10.09; ±43% decrease) and for YZ (polYZ= 74.99 to griYZ= 20.67; ±72% decrease) ceramics; and also promoted a more irregular topography with scratches and grooves. Fractographic and FEA analyses depicted the origin of failure at the higher stress concentration side during the impact test, where the pendulum impacted.

We find that both internal R&D activities and external knowledge sourcing have a positive effect on firms' innovation performance. Strong internal R&D capabilities also increase the effect of sourcing from value chain partners and horizontal connections, but we do not find support for complementarity between internal R&D and collaborations with universities and research labs.

The study indicates a rising interest of Big Pharma in acquisitions of and alliances with biotechnology companies. Unfortunately, this increased interest is not reflected in the number of new drugs generated by Big Pharma. We find that acquisitions of biotech companies have negatively affected Big Pharma firms' innovation performance on average but these acquisitions might have a positive effect at higher levels of acquiring firms' absorptive capacity. Moreover, also acquisitions of pharma companies and alliances with biotech companies only have a positive effect on innovation performance at sufficiently high levels of absorptive capacity. The moderating role of absorptive capacity implicates that a tight integration of internal R&D efforts and (unrelated) external knowledge is crucial for harnessing complementarity effects.</p>","Fernald, K.D.S.

https://doi.org/10.1140/epjst/e2012-01692-1,Theoretical and technological building blocks for an innovation accelerator,"Modern science is a main driver of technological innovation. The efficiency of the scientific system is of key importance to ensure the competitiveness of a nation or region. However, the scientific system that we use today was devised centuries ago and is inadequate for our current ICT-based society: the peer review system encourages conservatism, journal publications are monolithic and slow, data is often not available to other scientists, and the independent validation of results is limited. The resulting scientific process is hence slow and sloppy. Building on the Innovation Accelerator paper by Helbing and Balietti [1], this paper takes the initial global vision and reviews the theoretical and technological building blocks that can be used for implementing an innovation (in first place: science) accelerator platform driven by re-imagining the science system. The envisioned platform would rest on four pillars: (i) Redesign the incentive scheme to reduce behavior such as conservatism, herding and hyping; (ii) Advance scientific publications by breaking up the monolithic paper unit and introducing other building blocks such as data, tools, experiment workflows, resources; (iii) Use machine readable semantics for publications, debate structures, provenance etc. in order to include the computer as a partner in the scientific process, and (iv) Build an online platform for collaboration, including a network of trust and reputation among the different types of stakeholders in the scientific system: scientists, educators, funding agencies, policy makers, students and industrial innovators among others. Any such improvements to the scientific system must support the entire scientific process (unlike current tools that chop up the scientific process into disconnected pieces), must facilitate and encourage collaboration and interdisciplinarity (again unlike current tools), must facilitate the inclusion of intelligent computing in the scientific process, must facilitate not only the core scientific process, but also accommodate other stakeholders such science policy makers, industrial innovators, and the general public. We first describe the current state of the scientific system together with up to a dozen new key initiatives, including an analysis of the role of science as an innovation accelerator. Our brief survey will show that there exist many separate ideas and concepts and diverse stand-alone demonstrator systems for different components of the ecosystem with many parts are still unexplored, and overall integration lacking. By analyzing a matrix of stakeholders vs. functionalities, we identify the required innovations. We (non-exhaustively) discuss a few of them: Publications that are meaningful to machines, innovative reviewing processes, data publication, workflow archiving and reuse, alternative impact metrics, tools for the detection of trends, community formation and emergence, as well as modular publications, citation objects and debate graphs. To summarize, the core idea behind the Innovation Accelerator is to develop new incentive models, rules, and interaction mechanisms to stimulate true innovation, revolutionizing the way in which we create knowledge and disseminate information. © The Author(s) 2012.","Schultes, S.

The Brazilian case study demonstrates the crucial role of industrial policy in making the use of compulsory licensing in price negotiations with pharmaceutical multinational corporations to improve the access to patented ARV drugs. The evidence presented in this paper supports that it is indeed possible to achieve synergies between industrial and health policy in order to improve the access to medicines and promote accumulation of technological capabilities in pharmaceuticals. Several policy instruments and initiatives, both horizontal and vertical, were implemented to support the industrial dimension of the successful Brazilian health strategy. These initiatives include direct support to capacity building, public procurement, and institutional changes. Furthermore, industrial policy initiatives can contribute to success of health programmes either immediately or with a time lag.

Theory strongly suggests that product diversity is a major determinant of the demand for ABC systems. To date, the results of empirical research on the relationship between product diversity and ABC adoption have generally been inconclusive, however, suggesting that there either may be no strong relationship, or that methodological issues may have prevented researchers from consistently finding it. Using a dataset of survey responses from 191 Dutch, medium-sized manufacturing firms, this paper re-examines the relationship between product diversity and ABC adoption. Improving upon the measurement of product diversity and distinguishing between ABC adoption and use, it examines whether the relationship is curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) and/or moderated by usage of AMT. The paper contributes to the literature by showing that, consistent with the underlying theory, product diversity, on average, is positively related to both ABC adoption and ABC use, but also that these relationships are indeed inverted U-shaped and that the relationship with ABC use is negatively moderated by usage of AMT. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Schoute, M.",British Accounting Review,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

Studies have investigated these capabilities separately, although it seems to have an unexplored convergence between them. Therefore, this article aims to identify the digitalization and ecosystem-related capabilities of manufacturers in the agricultural machinery industry that are seeking digital servitization and offering smart product-service systems. Moreover, it aims to uncover the relationships among these capabilities to determine their driving and dependence power. A combination of methods was employed to achieve this result. First, a systematic literature review was conducted to define key digitalization and ecosystem-related capabilities. Next, the Interpretive Structural Modelling and fuzzy MICMAC analysis were employed to define the capabilities’ driving power and dependence power. By combining these analyses, we propose a conceptual framework that integrates these two sets of capabilities, which is comprised of three macro-layers: driving, linkage, and dependent. This article contributes to the literature by showing the interrelationships between digitalization and ecosystem-related capabilities. Also, it proposes a conceptual framework that groups capabilities based on their contributions to the development of digital service innovation.</p>","Coreynen, W.",Journal of Cleaner Production,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-5885.2010.00769.x,The role of value-informed pricing in market-oriented product innovation management,"Although the positive effect of a market orientation on new product success is widely accepted and the market orientation literature has increased its understanding of how a market orientation leads to performance, the extant literature has overlooked the role of value-informed pricing in the relationship. Value-informed pricing is a pricing practice in which the decision makers base the price of the new product on the customers' perceptions of the benefits that the product offers and how these benefits are traded by customers against the price (that has yet to be determined). Considering that pricing mistakes may hit hard on the profitability of product innovations, it is important to firms to have a good understanding of its role. This study develops a framework in which value-informed pricing is integrated in the relationship between market orientation and new product performance. A distinction is made between customer and competitor orientations, and relative product advantage is also included in the conceptual model. The model is tested on data obtained from managers based on a cross sectional sample of 144 firms. The respondents were involved in a decision-making process of the pricing of a new product. The model is tested using structural equations modeling. The results show that value-informed pricing has a strong effect on new product performance. It also reveals that each component of a market orientation fulfills a specific role in a market-oriented organization. Value-informed pricing is found to have important mediating effects in the market orientation-new product performance relationship. Results show that firms with a strong customer orientation engage in value-informed pricing and develop superior benefits to customers in an advantageous product. In turn, both value-informed pricing and relative product advantage positively affect new product market performance. However, no significant effect of competitor orientation on value-informed pricing is found. Combined with the finding that competitor orientation negatively affects relative product advantage, this suggests that competitor orientation may hurt new product performance when this orientation is not balanced with a strong customer orientation. The results also portray that value-informed pricing leads to higher product advantage. Interestingly, this relation is contingent on the degree of interfunctional coordination within the firm. This suggests that the relationship between market orientation and new product performance is strongest if firms integrate value-informed pricing in the new product development process. In this sense, a market-oriented firm mirrors the customer value perception that makes a trade-off between benefits and price. © 2010 Product Development & Management Association.","Frambach, R.T.",Journal of Product Innovation Management,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

The picture of the usefulness of trademarks for innovation studies, however, is far from complete. Starting with cues from the patent literature, this paper studies the relationship between the timing of trademark applications and innovation. The trademark literature provides competing predictions on whether companies apply for trademarks early or late in the innovation process. Using a large sample of trademarks referring to innovation, we undertake a first empirical test of these predictions. Our findings suggest that in many instances reality is not as clear cut as the predictions suggest. However, when trademark data is combined with data on firm age, sector and size it is possible to predict whether a trademark refers to early or late-stage innovation.</p>","Seip, M.

The analysis is based on data from in-depth interviews with seven manufacturing companies in the Netherlands which are actually engaged in this modern way of organising production. It is shown that the balance between transaction costs and sheer production costs (transformation costs) plays a prominent role in the strategic decisions on how and where to organise production. Especially intangible (or “soft”) transaction costs are important in this respect. The analysis provides insight in  practical experience in the manufacturing industry in the Netherlands with transaction costs and shows how transaction costs affect decisions on transaction management, personnel policy and internationalisation of R&D. This study is to our knowledge the first to confront the theory of TCE with practice of  manufacturing firms in their internationalisation decisions using in depth interviews instead of survey data.

Using data from the China Enterprise Survey of the World Bank, empirical findings suggest that the influence of B-G ties on Chinese firms' product innovation is different in distinctive institutional contexts in China. More specifically, during institutional transition, B-G ties become less efficient for facilitating product innovation when regional legal institutions and infrastructural supporting systems in a region are more stable, fair, and efficient. By contrast, during institutional transition, a positive effect of B-G ties on firm product innovation in a region becomes more significant when financial systems are relatively advanced. In addition to this, the value of B-G ties for firm product innovation appears to be more stable when business regulation develops within subnational regions.</p>","Peverelli, P.J.

This study aimed to compare the staining wear durability of different monolithic ceramics. Specimens of high translucent zirconia (YZHT), zirconia reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS), hybrid ceramic (HC) and feldspathic ceramic (FLD) were divided in five groups according to each material staining technique. The ZLS ceramic was tested with stained prior (ZLS1) and after crystallization (ZLS2). All specimens were extrinsically characterized, i.e. stained, and crystallized or sintered in specific ovens, according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The specimens were submitted to three-body wear tests in ACTA wear machine, simulating the presence of food bolus and antagonist (pH 7, 15 N, 1 Hz). The wear rate of the stain surface was determined after 5 intervals of 200,000 cycles, using a profilometer. The ceramic surface before and after staining, and after wear were inspected by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The wear rates were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey test. The wear rates of the staining were affected by ceramic and the number of cycles (P < 0.001). 100% of staining was removed after 200,000 cycles for HC, and after 600,000 cycles for YZHT and ZLS1. Staining of ZLS2 and FLD remained on ceramic surface even after 1,000,000 cycles. Furthermore, FLD showed a significant higher staining durability than ZLS2. SEM revealed different surface morphologies for each group with and without staining and after the wear test. Ceramics with fired staining showed higher durability compared to the polymerized one. The feldspar ceramic presented superior staining durability, followed by zirconia reinforced lithium silicate and high translucent zirconia. The conventional two steps staining technique showed improved durability for zirconia reinforced lithium silicate.</p>","Werner, A.

Here, we present a dual-band nanoplasmonic ruler comprising mixed arrays of plasmonic nanoparticles with spectrally separated resonance peaks. As electrodynamic simulations and model experiments show, the ruler enables real-time simultaneous measurements of thickness and refractive index variations in uniform and heterogeneous layers with sub-nanometer resolution. Additionally, nanostructure shape changes can be tracked, as demonstrated by quantifying the degree of lipid vesicle deformation at the critical coverage prior to rupture and supported lipid bilayer formation.

This innovation paradox is in part caused by stakeholders lacking complete understanding of the complex array of steps necessary for vaccine development and collaboration difficulties between the wide variety of stakeholders involved. Models providing cross-domain understanding can improve collaboration but currently lack both comprehensibility and granularity to enable a prioritized view of activities and criteria. Key opinion leaders (KOLs) were asked to contribute to the definition of a vaccine innovation cycle (VIC). In a first step, 18 KOLs were interviewed on the stages (activities and results) and gates (evaluation criteria and outcomes) of vaccine innovation. This first description of the VIC was subsequently validated and refined through a survey among 46 additional KOLs. The VIC identifies 29 distinct stages and 28 corresponding gates, distributed in ten different but integrated workstreams, and comprehensibly depicted in a circular innovation model. Some stage-gates occur at defined moments, whereas the occurrence and timing of other stage-gates is contingent on a variety of contextual factors. Yet other stage-gates continuously monitor internal and external developments. A gap-overlap analysis of stage-gate criteria demonstrated that 5 out of 11 criteria employed by vaccine developers correspond with criteria employed by competent (regulatory) authorities. The VIC provides a comprehensive overview of stage-gates throughout the value chain of vaccine innovation. Its cyclical nature highlights the importance of synchronizing with unmet needs and market changes, and conceptualizes the difference between incremental and radical vaccine innovation. Knowledge on the gap between internal and external criteria will enhance the viability of newcomers to the field. The VIC can be used by stakeholders to improve understanding and communication in forming collaborative alliances and consortia. Such a boundary-spanning function may contribute to the reduction of process inefficiencies, especially in public-private partnerships.</p>","van der Waal, M.B.

Empirical evidence seems to corroborate this relationship. However, in trading countries like The Netherlands, productivity increases, even in industry, can also be the result of innovations in the way transactions are managed. These innovations reduce transaction costs and exploit the welfare gains from (further) international division of labour. Such innovations are only partly included in R&D data. Consequently there is not much attention for these 'trade innovations'-as we label them-in policy. In an empirical analysis this paper compares the influence of trade innovations with the influence of the stock of R&D on TFP in The Netherlands.

One might anticipate that by inducing specialization, trade limits the potential for convergence in energy productivity. Conversely, by inducing competition and knowledge diffusion, trade may spur sectors to greater energy productivity. Unlike most previous work on convergence, we explain productivity dynamics from cross-country interactions at a detailed sector level and apply a spatial panel data approach to explicitly account for trade-flow related spatial effects in the convergence analysis. Our study confirms the existence of convergence in manufacturing energy productivity, caused by efficiency improvements in lagging countries, while undermined by increasing international differences in sector structure. Further, we find that trade flows explain 30 to 40% of the unobserved variation in energy productivity. Trade continues to explain the unobserved variation in energy productivity even after accounting for geographic proximity. Last, we find that those countries and sectors with higher dependence on trade both have higher energy productivity growth and a higher rate of convergence, further implying that trade can enhance energy productivity. Thus, unlike concerns that trade may spur a 'race to the bottom', we find that promoting trade may help stimulate energy efficiency improvements across countries.","Mulder, P.",Energy Economics,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

Based on a sample of Benelux and Community trademarks, we find that trademarks for brand creation relate more often to product innovation. In addition, we find negative effects of a trademark's industry scope on its relatedness to product innovation, and of a trademark's geographic scope on its relatedness to service innovation.

The outcomes of the study may contribute to a further understanding of how authentic leadership affects open innovation in different national cultures. The originality of this study is that it is conducted among ICT-organisations as well in India as the Netherlands in looking for differences in the perception of authentic leadership and its effect on open innovation.</p>","Lub, X.D.",International journal of business and globalisation,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

This paper identifies four notions on the dynamics of adoption of complex novel technologies and two main challenges that hinder adoption. These insights derive from studying literature and analysing the implementation history of the first eight growers that adopted the novel system innovation closed greenhouse. The analysis of these eight histories shows that variety exists in how users value an innovation and that adopters reconstruct the innovation, which creates high levels of uncertainty about the functioning of the system innovation. To stimulate the adoption of novel system innovations and to keep initial values in-scripted, we suggest innovation policy makers to further shelter the system innovation until the stage of take-off. © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Beekman, V.

Why do some countries urbanize faster while having worse economic growth? This paper finds that higher aggregate agricultural risk induces rural-urban migration, providing an additional channel to explain the urbanization trend. Uninsurable expected risk will lead to rural-urban migration as a form of ex-ante insurance if households are liquidity constrained and cannot overcome adverse shocks. The effect is robust to controlling for the traditional view of urbanization driven by industrialization, and to several alternative explanations such as government spending. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Poelhekke, S.",Journal of Development Economics,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"

Technology in business and society debates,"This review argues that the role of technology in business and society debates has predominantly been examined from the limited, narrow perspective of technology as instrumental, and that two additional but relatively neglected perspectives are important: technology as value laden and technology as relationally agentic. Technology has always been part of the relationship between business and society, for better and worse. However, as technological development is frequently advanced as a solution to many pressing societal problems and grand challenges, it is imperative that technology is understood and analyzed in a more nuanced, critical, and comprehensive way. The two additional perspectives invite a broader research agenda, one that includes questions such as: ‘Which values and whose interests has technology come to emulate?’, ‘How do these values and interests play out in stabilizing the status quo?’, and, importantly, ‘How can it be contested, disrupted, and changed?’ Any research that endorses green, sustainable, environmental, or climate mitigating technologies potentially contributes to maintaining the very thing that it seeks to change if questions such as these are not being addressed.","den Hond, F.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2018.03.003,Using multi-relational data mining to discriminate blended therapy efficiency on patients based on log data,"<p>Introduction: Clinical trials of blended Internet-based treatments deliver a wealth of data from various sources, such as self-report questionnaires, diagnostic interviews, treatment platform log files and Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA). Mining these complex data for clinically relevant patterns is a daunting task for which no definitive best method exists. In this paper, we explore the expressive power of the multi-relational Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) data mining approach, using combined trial data of the EU E-COMPARED depression trial. Methods: We explored the capability of ILP to handle and combine (implicit) multiple relationships in the E-COMPARED data. This data set has the following features that favor ILP analysis: 1) Time reasoning is involved; 2) there is a reasonable amount of explicit useful relations to be analyzed; 3) ILP is capable of building comprehensible models that might be perceived as putative explanations by domain experts; 4) both numerical and statistical models may coexist within ILP models if necessary. In our analyses, we focused on scores of the PHQ-8 self-report questionnaire (which taps depressive symptom severity), and on EMA of mood and various other clinically relevant factors. Both measures were administered during treatment, which lasted between 9 to 16 weeks. Results: E-COMPARED trial data revealed different individual improvement patterns: PHQ-8 scores suggested that some individuals improved quickly during the first weeks of the treatment, while others improved at a (much) slower pace, or not at all. Combining self-reported Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA), PHQ-8 scores and log data about the usage of the ICT4D platform in the context of blended care, we set out to unveil possible causes for these different trajectories. Discussion: This work complements other studies into alternative data mining approaches to E-COMPARED trial data analysis, which are all aimed to identify clinically meaningful predictors of system use and treatment outcome. Strengths and limitations of the ILP approach given this objective will be discussed.</p>","Riper, M.M. (+1 more)",Internet Interventions,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-5885.2010.00775.x,Using product bundling as facilitator of the adoption process of radical innovations,"Generally, radical innovations are not easily adopted in the market. Potential adopters experience difficulties to comprehend and evaluate radical innovations due to their newness in terms of technology and benefits offered. Consequently, adoption intentions may remain low. This paper proposes bundling as an instrument to address these problems. More specifically, this paper examines how consumer comprehension, evaluation, and adoption intention of radical innovations may be enhanced by bundling such products with existing products. In addition, it is argued that the proposed effects are contingent upon the level of fit perceived to exist between the radical innovation and the product that accompanies it in the bundle. Furthermore, consumers' prior knowledge may affect the influence of bundling on the innovation adoption process as the interpretation of the meaning of new products may be strongly related to prior knowledge. This study therefore investigates whether consumer prior knowledge has such a moderating effect. Hypotheses are tested by means of an experimental study with three different radical innovations and distinguishing among offering the radical innovation separately, offering the radical innovation in a bundle with moderate perceived fit between the products, and offering the radical innovation in a bundle with high perceived fit between the products. Results show that product bundling enhances the new product's evaluation and adoption intention, although it does not increase comprehension of the radical innovation. Moreover, the results show that comprehension, evaluation and adoption intention of the innovation significantly decrease when consumers perceive a moderate fit between the products in a bundle. Taken together, these findings contribute to the bundling literature by showing not only that product bundling may indeed be an effective instrument to introduce a radical innovation but also that product bundling may be counterproductive when ignoring the critical role of perceived product fit as core characteristic of a product bundle. In addition, the notion that product bundling helps to enhance the evaluation and purchase intention of new and relatively complex products suggests a suitable strategy for new product managers to enhance benefits and reduce learning costs for radical innovations. Moreover, the effects of bundling on consumer appraisals of radical innovations are also shown to depend on the level of knowledge respondents possess regarding the product category of the radical innovation. More specifically, if bundled with a familiar product, novices tend to evaluate the innovative product more positively, but for experts no such effect can be detected. As such, these results provide additional specific implications for managers when introducing radical innovations in the market. Offering a radical innovation in a product bundle could be a fruitful strategy for companies that target customers with little or no prior knowledge in the product domain. © 2010 Product Development & Management Association.","Frambach, R.T.

https://doi.org/10.1177/0007650320907145,Valuing value in innovation ecosystems,"This article aims to uncover the processes of developing sustainable business models in innovation ecosystems. Innovation ecosystems with sustainability goals often consist of cross-sector partners and need to manage three tensions: the tension of value creation versus value capture, the tension of mutual value versus individual value, and the tension of gaining value versus losing value. The fact that these tensions affect all actors differently makes the process of developing a sustainable business model challenging. Based on a study of four sustainably innovative cross-sector collaborations, we propose that innovation ecosystems that develop a sustainable business model engage in a process of valuing value in which they search for a result that satisfies all actors. We find two different patterns of valuing value: collective orchestration and continuous search. We describe these patterns and the conditions that give rise to them. The identification of the two patterns opens up a research agenda that can shed further light on the conditions that need to be in place in order for an innovation ecosystem to develop effective sustainable business models. For practice, our findings show how cross-sector actors in innovation ecosystems may collaborate when developing a business model around emerging sustainability-oriented innovations.","Oskam, I.F.

External customers arrive at the queues according to independent Poisson processes. After completing service, a customer either leaves the system or is routed to another queue. This model is very generic and finds many applications in computer systems, communication networks, manufacturing systems, and robotics. Special cases of the introduced network include well-known polling models, tandem queues, systems with a waiting room, multi-stage models with parallel queues, and many others. A complicating factor of this model is that the internally rerouted customers do not arrive at the various queues according to a Poisson process, causing standard techniques to find waiting-time distributions to fail. In this paper, we develop a new method to obtain exact expressions for the Laplace-Stieltjes transforms of the steady-state waiting-time distributions. This method can be applied to a wide variety of models which lacked an analysis of the waiting-time distribution until now. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","van der Mei, R.D.

LPMO-driven cellulose oxidation can be enhanced considerably through photobiocatalysis using chlorophyll derivatives and light. Water soluble chlorophyll binding proteins (WSCPs) make it is possible to stabilize and solubilize chlorophyll in aqueous solution, allowing for in vitro studies on photostability and ROS production. Here we aim to apply WSCP–Chl a as a photosensitizing complex for photobiocatalysis with the LPMO, TtAA9. Results: We have in this study demonstrated how WSCP reconstituted with chlorophyll a (WSCP–Chl a) can create a stable photosensitizing complex which produces controlled amounts of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the presence of ascorbic acid and light. WSCP–Chl a is highly reactive and allows for tightly controlled formation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by regulating light intensity. TtAA9 together with WSCP–Chl a shows increased cellulose oxidation under low light conditions, and the WSCP–Chl a complex remains stable after 24 h of light exposure. Additionally, the WSCP–Chl a complex demonstrates stability over a range of temperatures and pH conditions relevant for enzyme activity in industrial settings. Conclusion: With WSCP–Chl a as the photosensitizer, the need to replenish Chl is greatly reduced, enhancing the catalytic lifetime of light-driven LPMOs and increasing the efficiency of cellulose depolymerization. WSCP–Chl a allows for stable photobiocatalysis providing a sustainable solution for biomass processing.</p>","Croce, R.

Effective treatment for employees with depressive symptoms in occupational health care is limited. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an indicated preventive web-based guided self-help course for employees with depressive symptoms. Methods: The study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial comparing a web-based guided self-help course with care-as-usual. The self-help course consists of 6 weekly lessons. Weekly support will be provided by a coach via the website. Subjects in the care-as-usual group do not receive any treatment in addition to regular care. 200 white collar workers from several national and international companies in the Netherlands will be recruited via different methods such as banners on the company's intranet, pamphlets and posters. Subjects will be included when they: have elevated depressive symptoms (score ≥16 on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale), are 18 years of age or older, have access to the Internet and can be contacted via e-mail. Exclusion criteria are: partial or full work absenteeism, a legal labor dispute with the employer and receiving treatment from the company's occupational health care at study entrance.The primary outcome is depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes include work absenteeism, work performance, burnout, anxiety, quality of life, health care use and production losses. Outcome data will be collected at 8 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after baseline. Analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. The cost-effectiveness analyses will be performed from a societal and a company's perspective. A process evaluation will be conducted alongside the study.Discussion: This study evaluates the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a web-based guided self-help course for employees with depressive symptoms.

This study explores organizational-, individual- and patent-level factors and their respective relationship with academic patenting. Based on a thorough investigation of all academic patents (that have at least one university scientist involved) from one of the largest Dutch research universities during the period 2000–2009, and further building on first-hand qualitative and quantitative data, the results show that Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) are instrumental in generating more academic patents. However, this effect is predominantly manifested by the increase in the number of patents patented under the name (solely or jointly) of the university (university-owned patents), far more than the increase in the absolute volume of patents invented by the university (university-invented patents). Further, regarding individual academic inventors, our study shows that, in general, male researchers and lead-inventors with higher academic rankings are less likely to abide by the TTOs, resulting in more patents being filed outside the university. Regarding the academic invention, the value of the patent itself does not seem to be related to the choice of the ownership (e.g., university-owned or not) of the patent.</p>","Du, J.

https://doi.org/10.1111/jpim.12249,When Research Meets Development: Antecedents and Implications of Transfer Speed,"This paper focuses on the organization of new product development in large, R&D-intensive firms. In these firms, research and development activities are often separated. Research is conducted in dedicated research projects at specialized research labs. Once research results are achieved by research projects, they are transferred to business units for further development and commercialization. We investigate the speed whereby research projects transfer their first research results to business units (hereafter: transfer speed). In particular, we analyze the antecedents and performance implications of transfer speed. Based on data of 503 research projects from a European R&D intensive manufacturing firm, our results suggest that a fast transfer speed (as measured by the time it takes for a research project to develop and transfer its first research result to business units) is associated with a better research performance (as measured by the total number of transfers the research project generates). Moreover, we find that different types of external R&D partners - science-based and market-based partners - play distinct roles in speeding up project first research transfers. While market-based partnerships (i.e., customers and suppliers) generally contribute to a faster transfer of first research results, science-based partnerships (i.e., universities and research institutions) only speed up first research transfers of technologically very complex projects. Our results also show that early patent filings by research projects accelerate first research transfers.","Du, J.",Journal of Product Innovation Management,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (+1 more)"
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wpi.2013.12.002,Why do firms give away their patents for free?,"Within the trend of increasing patent commercialisation and open innovation, a recent phenomenon where firms give away their patents free of charge can be observed. This seems contradictory to the original intention of the patent system (enabling firms to create temporary monopolies to appropriate returns from their R&D investments). Consequently, this paper explores why firms make their patents available for free and which benefits they may gain from this behaviour. Adopting the open source software phenomenon as a background and using firm data from 26 patent release cases, we identify a typology consisting of four motives of 'free patent release approaches': profit making, cost cutting, innovation catalysing, technology providing. Further, we discuss the motives of these firms to offer their patents as 'open source'. We find that firms may obtain valuable technological input for subsequent innovations as well as social benefits in return for their free patent release. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Friesike, S.C.",World Patent Information,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"

We analyse a private dataset of crowdfunding campaigns, comprising ex-ante community metrics and rich qualitative measures to determine how the social ties embedded within multiple coexisting online creator-fan communication channels impact the conversion of fans into campaign funders. Using a combination of negative binomial and logistic regressions, we find evidence of a clear hierarchy of importance of online communication channels, with email representing the most effective medium, followed by Facebook, and Twitter is the least important. This finding both supports the contention that stronger social ties are better relied upon for financial support, and shines a light on the importance of email, an otherwise under-considered factor in crowdfunding performance. A quantile regression analysis further demonstrates that the importance of social ties maintained through email tends to be relatively greater among better-performing campaigns, while for poorly performing campaigns the importance of the length of the written campaign description is greater. We conclude by offering several thoughts on how CCI creators can manage their online fan networks to develop stronger social ties and thus maximise the results of future D2F activities.","Tosatto, J.",Computers in Human Behavior,"SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure"
